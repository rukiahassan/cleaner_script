As of February 4, 2025, citizens of the Dominican Republic now enjoy a visa waiver for travel to Jamaica for visits up to 180 days. This will streamline the travel process and foster greater cultural and economic exchange between the two island nations. “This visa waiver represents our commitment to breaking down barriers to inter-Caribbean travel, by creating a more interconnected region,” said Minister of Tourism, Hon. Edmund Bartlett. “By facilitating easier movement between our countries, we’re opening doors to new tourism opportunities that benefit both destinations from the cultural exchange to greater economic benefits.” The policy change is expected to significantly boost multi-destination tourism experiences, allowing visitors to experience the unique cultural offerings of both islands in a single trip. Visitors can now seamlessly combine Jamaica’s renowned beaches, music, and cuisine with the Dominican Republic’s rich colonial history and diverse natural landscapes. Senator, the Hon Aubyn Hill, Minister of Industry, Investment and Commerce and H.E Angie Martinez, Dominican Republic Ambassador to Jamaica, both endorsed and welcomed the significant move that will allow for greater facilitation of movement, tourism and business between both countries. “This visa waiver represents a historic milestone in Dominican-Jamaican relations,” said H.E. Angie Martinez, Dominican Republic Ambassador to Jamaica. “It opens a new chapter of opportunity for our nations, paving the way for deeper economic ties, expanded business ventures, and stronger tourism collaboration. This decision will be remembered as the moment our countries chose to grow together, fostering greater people-to-people connections that will benefit generations to come.” Minister of Tourism, Hon.

Responsible Travel Uncovered in London,https://eturbonews.com/responsible-travel-uncovered-in-london/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","March 4, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Responsible travel is a collective obligation within the tourism ecosystem, with destinations playing a crucial role in fostering and directing sustainable tourism practices. This was a significant conclusion drawn from a recent discussion hosted by the Association of National Tourist Office Representatives (ANTOR) and the British Guild of Travel Writers (BGTW). Website for travel writers takes off Total flexibility and search-ability, constantly updated pages and an enhanced member database and contacts book are among the many features of the dynamic revamped website launched by The British Gui The event, held at the Little Ship Club in London, featured participation from 11 ANTOR member destinations and 24 travel writers, who engaged in a dynamic dialogue regarding the challenges, opportunities, and responsibilities associated with responsible travel. Central to the discussion was a shared understanding that while travelers are encouraged to make informed decisions, it is the responsibility of destinations to facilitate and promote responsible tourism. This dedication underpins ANTOR’s “Better Travel Pathway,” an initiative aimed at assisting destinations in advocating for sustainable tourism. United for Sustainable Tourism | Antor Association Join ANTOR, the global voice for sustainable tourism. Connect with national tourist offices and explore responsible travel options worldwide. Key Issues Addressed in the Discussion: Sustainability and Greenwashing: Numerous businesses assert their eco-friendly credentials, yet transparency is vital. Certifications such as B Corp, EarthCheck, and Green Key can serve to validate these claims. Luxury and Responsibility: The luxury sector possesses the potential to spearhead investments in sustainability; however, responsible travel should also be attainable across all market segments. The Role of Social Media: Can it serve as a positive influence? Destinations ought to utilize social media for educational purposes rather than solely for promotional activities. Encouraging Travel to Secondary and Tertiary Cities: Promoting travel beyond primary urban centers can distribute economic advantages and alleviate congestion. Public Transport and Slow Travel: Sustainable transportation is essential, yet challenges persist, including high costs, such as train fares in the UK, and a general lack of awareness regarding options like coach travel in the USA and the feasibility of short stays. Tourism Tax and Funding: There is a need for increased transparency concerning how tourism taxes contribute to sustainability, and National Tourist Offices (NTOs) should play a role in educating both governments and travelers. Cultural Sensitivity and Local Impact: Travelers are urged to honor local communities, which includes supporting genuine farm-to-table experiences and engaging with indigenous and underrepresented groups. Tracey Poggio, Antor Chair said: “Responsible travel is a shared effort. While travelers must make conscious decisions, destinations have a duty to facilitate responsible travel within their borders. ANTOR’s Better Travel Pathway will serve as a key resource in this effort, and the media must play its part in spreading awareness and guiding travelers toward sustainable options.” Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel
Sustainable Tourism and Eco Tourism Building a Better Future,https://eturbonews.com/sustainable-tourism-and-eco-tourism-building-a-better-future/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","March 3, 2025",N/A,Dr. Peter E. Tarlow,"Although there is no single definition of tourism and the industry’s records can be dependent on local methodologies, we can “guestimate” that the average tourist spends at least US$700 per trip. A conservative estimate of the impact of travel might be around US$700 billion per year. Assuming these figures are correct, then a fair estimate is that tourism produces about 10% of all of the world’s jobs. Over the last decade one of tourism’s popular phrases has been “sustainable tourism.” Despite the word’s popularity, there are many different interpretations of what the phrase means. Often it appears that there is an overlap between what is called sustainable tourism and eco-friendly tourism. To add to the complexity, just as there are many forms of tourism, there are also many forms of sustainable tourism. For example, sustainable urban tourism is different from sustainable rural tourism, aquatic tourism or beach tourism. For the most part we can define sustainable tourism as a form of travel and tourism that permits outsiders to visit a place without creating a harmful impact to such a degree that the visitors destroy what they came to see. Sustainable tourism seeks to protect the locale’s culture, environment, economy, and way of life. Despite the ongoing efforts by many in the tourism industry it is still not certain that this goal is attainable. Many sociologists and anthropologists would argue that the moment a “foreign” body or substance has entered into the eco-bio system, that system is changed forever. Eco-friendly tourism might be easier to define. Ecofriendly tourism (often spelled ecotourism as one word) focuses on such things as local cultures, wilderness experiences, or learning new ways to live on the planet. Some people define eco-friendly tourism as travel to destinations where the primary attractions are the locale’s flora, fauna, or even its cultural heritage. Both sustainable tourism and eco-tourism attempt to minimize the adverse effects of what these tourism professionals believe is the harmful impact of overtourism. As such, many who work in sustainable tourism or eco-tourism will argue that they are not trying to stop tourism but rather to package it in a way that the tourism’s impact on the local physical and cultural environment will be the most minimal possible. It is for this reason that major tourism hubs such as Venice, Italy, Barcelona, Spain, and Ecuador’s Galapagos islands have promulgated new laws that limit the number of visitors to their locale at any one time. It is also for this reason sustainable and ecotourism specialists seek to find ways to recycle waste as efficiently as possible, to use water resources sparingly, to control trash locations and to prevent noise, light and water pollution. Because tourism cannot survive if overtourism destroys precisely the reason that people visit that locale, Here are several ideas regarding ways that travel and tourism are both sustainable and environmentally friendly for years to come. Take extra care of your water resources Tourism is beginning to make some long-needed strides in this area, but the recent fires in Los Angeles demonstrate that there is much to do. From asking guests at hotels to use their towels for more than one day to changing bed sheets every three days (during prolonged stays), the industry has succeeded in reducing the amounts of detergents and other toxins that enter into local water systems. Much more, however, can and should be done. Innovations such as the Israeli model of drip irrigation can be applied to golf courses and outdoor stadiums. New forms of detergents need to be developed. Showers and toilets throughout the world need to have water saving devices; visitors should be rewarded for making ecologically sound decisions. Promote local products The use of local products is not only good for the ecology, but it is the basis of tourism. Local products are fresher and provide a local flavor. Some ecologists believe that they also reduce emissions into the atmosphere by at least 4%. Local products are less costly to transport and their transportation uses less energy. Local products then are not only good for the environment but they are also good for your tourism product. Protect and promote your local flora and fauna Just as in the case of food, local flora and fauna help to distinguish your location from other locations. Even urban environments have plants and flowers that are (or were) native to their soil. Plants not only add a sense of beautification to the environment, but they increase the supply of oxygen, and beautification is one of the least expensive ways to lower crime rates. Plant and replenish your locale’s tree population Trees not only add shade and beauty to a locale but also are a major source in absorbing carbon pollutants. Make sure to plant trees that are compatible with your environment and are in sync with your water resources. Tourism locales should use native trees to add not only beauty but also a touch of what makes your community unique. The need for urban tree planting is especially essential when you consider that half of the world’s population lives in urban areas. In some parts of the world, such as in Latin America, the figures may be as high as 70% and many of these Latin American cities not only suffer from traffic congestion but also lack parks and green areas. If your tourism locale is by any medium or large body of water, take care of the aquatic areas in addition to the land Too many of our world’s oceans have become dumping grounds, impacting the beaches and fishing. For example, many of the Caribbean’s coral reefs are threatened or poorly protected. Once these resources are lost, they may be lost forever. Over 70% of the earth’s surface is covered by water and what happens in the aquatic world will impact the terrestrial world. World Tourism Network (WTN) WTN is the Voice for Small and Medium Size Businesses (SMEs) for the Global Travel and Tourism Industry in more than 130 countries. The author, Dr. Peter E. Tarlow, is President and Co-Founder of the World Tourism Network and leads the Safer Tourism program. The Doha Forum Focus on Solutions for Security and Sustainable Growth Airlines such as Etihad, Emirates, and Turkish have been outspoken about their commitment to sustainable growth. Also, Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Officer Engr. Badr Mohammed Al-Meer affirms his airline’s position at Doha Forum 2024. The 22nd edition of the Doha Forum was held under the patronage of His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.

Latvians in Russia or Belarus could potentially face recruitment for espionage, as well as exposure to intelligence activities and provocation risks, as stated by the deputies who proposed the amendments. All Americans Told to Leave Belarus Immediately In its latest advisory, US State Department warned about the “increased volatility and unpredictable nature of the regional security situation,” due to Belarus’ support for Russia in its ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine. Latvia, along with neighboring Estonia and Lithuania, has emerged as one of the most vocal opponents of Russia in the wake of Putin’s unprovoked brutal full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago. Official statistics indicate that 90% of people crossing the Latvia-Belarus border are solo travelers.

New amendments would prevent all travel agencies officially registered in Latvia from offering or providing tourism services in Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, as stated in an official announcement. This prohibition would be enforced in conjunction with the existing EU sanctions targeting Moscow and Minsk, the statement further indicated.

"Berlin-Brandenburg Tourism: Overnight Stays, Guest Numbers Rising",https://eturbonews.com/berlin-brandenburg-tourism-overnight-stays-guest-numbers-rising/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","March 3, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"The Berlin-Brandenburg Office for Statistics has published the tourism figures for 2024. 5.4 million guests came to Brandenburg, 4.5 percent more than in 2023. The number of overnight stays also increased again, reaching 14.4 million in 2024. This corresponds to an increase of 1.2 percent compared to the previous year and 3.1 percent compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019. Lufthansa: Positive results at Berlin-Brandenburg Airport Just over a month after moving from Tegel to the new Berlin-Brandenburg Airport, the Lufthansa Group is showing positive results. The airlines’ relocation “The figures are very encouraging. They show that Brandenburg continues to be very popular as a holiday destination. Our Brandenburg nature and the wide range of offers it offers are particularly impressive. They are real growth drivers! Berlin-Brandenburg Airport is also having positive effects,” said Economics Minister Daniel Keller at a joint press breakfast with TMB Tourismus-Marketing Brandenburg in the run-up to tomorrow’s opening of the International Tourism Exchange (ITB) in Berlin. However, it is important to take a differentiated view of the industry. “While sales in the accommodation sector are growing, there are cuts in the catering sector,” explained Keller. The minister pointed out that the TMB is currently preparing a study on the future of gastronomy. “It is important to develop innovative business models to stimulate the industry again,” said Keller. Whether hotels, campsites or holiday centers with holiday homes – almost all segments have stable or increasing overnight stays. Only group accommodations are still behind the 2019 figures. Herzlich willkommen bei der Als zentrale Destinations-Management-Organisation sind wir für die langfristige und nachhaltige Positionierung sowie Entwicklung und Vermarktung der touristischen Angebote im Land Brandenburg verantwortlich. Auf Basis der Landestourismuskonzeption Brandenburg wirken wir als übergeordnete Steuerungs- und Kommunikationsinstitution für den Tourismus und alle daran beteiligten Akteure im Land. Vor diesem Hintergrund kooperieren wir mit fachlich und strategisch wichtigen Partnern im Land, den benachbarten Bundesländern, der Deutschen Zentrale für Tourismus sowie Unternehmen der Privatwirtschaft. Damit unterstützen wir die landespolitischen Zielsetzungen, die durch den Tourismus positiv befördert werden. The number of overnight stays and guests from international markets has also continued to grow. In 2024, 483,000 guests from abroad came to Brandenburg, booking 1.14 million overnight stays. This corresponds to an increase of 4.3 and 2.7 percent respectively. Poland continues to be Brandenburg’s most important foreign source market. TMB Managing Director Christian Woronka: “The tourism figures for 2024 are a strong signal of Brandenburg’s attractiveness as a travel destination. These successes are the result of the great cooperation between entrepreneurs, employees and all players in the industry. Tourism is a joint effort that not only benefits guests, but also promotes the quality of life and prosperity in our region. I look forward to continuing to work with partners in the industry on the further development and success of Brandenburg as a tourist destination.” Nature also at the forefront for day trips The balance sheet also includes a look at day tourism, which plays a major role in Brandenburg. The desire for relaxation in nature is unbroken. However, the recently presented tourism barometer of the East German Savings Bank Association shows that the proportion of activities such as shopping or visiting leisure facilities and events has decreased in the past year. Increased living costs and the associated reluctance to spend on leisure time could play a role here. Water tourism continues to be at a high level Water tourism in the Berlin-Brandenburg region is at a high level in terms of supply and demand. A total of 300 million euros in gross sales are generated annually in the areas of boat charter, canoe rental, passenger shipping and pleasure boat harbors in the Brandenburg-Berlin region. Opportunities lie in cross-border cooperation and sustainable, quality-oriented development. Gastronomy study and municipal tax law The declining purchasing power – in addition to higher prices, rising costs for energy, personnel and purchasing goods – is also affecting the gastronomy sector. This is shown by the economic statistics for 2024 published last Friday, which show losses in real sales in the gastronomy sector of 4.9 percent. A study on the future of gastronomy, which is being carried out this year under the leadership of the TMB, is intended to show innovative business models and solutions together with associations and regions. At the municipal level, the change in the municipal tax law now makes it possible for more municipalities to collect guest contributions and thus finance investments in the tourist infrastructure, for example. The TMB is offering municipalities information events and consultations this year. Potential for Brandenburg tourism Potential for further quality-oriented growth of Brandenburg tourism exists particularly in the low season, which is to be strengthened by communication measures. The value-added-intensive segment of meetings and conferences also plays a role, which is further strengthened by trend topics such as workation. Aspects of sustainability, which also include social participation, are also increasingly in focus. Brandenburg has long been actively committed to barrier-free tourism. Digitalization remains an important basis for competitive tourism. “Stay on the ball” is the motto here, for example through augmented reality. Seven different smartphone applications have been developed for use in tourism and culture. They will be presented in the first half of 2025.

Reflecting on his contributions, Minister Bartlett hailed Mr. Reid as a visionary and an ardent champion of Jamaica’s tourism sector. “Tourism has lost a great stalwart. A gentleman, urbane, and sophisticated. His sense of correctness and diligence to duty was unparalleled,” Minister Bartlett said. Mr. Reid’s service to Jamaica’s tourism sector was marked by transformative leadership. He first served as President of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association (JHTA) from 1993 to 1997 before assuming the role of Executive Director of JAMVAC from 2008 to 2012. He later returned as Chairman of JAMVAC from 2016 to 2018, playing an instrumental role in shaping Jamaica’s airlift strategy. Among his most enduring contributions was his pivotal role in securing Jamaica’s air connectivity with the United States following the cessation of Air Jamaica’s operations. Minister Bartlett underscored his impact, noting that “to his eternal legacy will be ascribed Jamaica’s strong airlift security. As chairman and Executive Director of JAMVAC, along with John Lynch, the then executive chairman of the JTB, Lionel played a leading role in the negotiations with American Airlines to future-proof our air connectivity with the USA, our most significant market. This will never be erased.” Minister Bartlett extended his deepest condolences on behalf of the Ministry of Tourism and its public bodies, as well as the wider tourism fraternity to Mr. Reid’s family, friends, and colleagues. “My deepest and most sincere condolences to his dear widow Vonnie and the children, as well as the huge extended tourism family.

Tanzanian Tourism Takes $150M Hit Over Alleged Human Right Abuses,https://eturbonews.com/tanzanian-tourism-takes-150m-hit-over-alleged-human-right-abuses/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 28, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"The World Bank, an international financial institution that provides loans and grants to the governments of low- and middle-income countries for the purposes of economic development, has announced its decision to withdraw a $150 million tourism development initiative in Tanzania’s Ruaha National Park due to allegations of human rights violations by the park authorities. Ruaha National Park | Book Accommodation and Safaris Directly Find your preferred places to stay or your dream safari in Ruaha National Park and contact them directly. We support direct bookings where you are in charge. Contact properties and safari operators directly. This decision represents a considerable setback for the project, which was intended to enhance tourism and conservation efforts within one of Tanzania’s largest national parks. According to local news sources, the Tanzanian government’s plans to expand Ruaha National Park could potentially displace 21,000 local residents. The initiative, known as Resilient Natural Resource Management for Tourism and Growth (REGROW), was aimed at increasing tourism revenue in Ruaha and other southern parks in Tanzania, which attract fewer visitors compared to the more famous Serengeti and Ngorongoro parks in the north. In 2008, the Tanzanian government issued a decree that expanded Ruaha’s boundaries, a decision reaffirmed in 2022. Implementing this plan could necessitate the eviction of tens of thousands of villagers. The Oakland Institute, a US-based advocacy organization, along with local residents,claimed that rangers from the Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA) have engaged in a campaign of intimidation against pastoralists and farmers within the expansion zone. This campaign allegedly includes tactics such as extrajudicial killings, cattle confiscation, and enforced disappearances. Oakland Institute posted statements from ‘affected villagers’ expressing their opposition to the proposed expansion of Ruaha. “Our lives are in a state of uncertainty as the constant threat of eviction hangs over us daily. For years, our livelihoods have been compromised, our children are unable to attend school, our farms remain uncultivated, and our cattle continue to be forcibly taken from us. We cannot endure this situation any longer,” they stated. In 2023, the Oakland Institute assisted two local residents in submitting a complaint against REGROW to the World Bank’s Inspection Panel, alleging that the bank had not adhered to its internal safeguard policies. In response to the allegations, the bank dispatched a delegation to investigate the claims and subsequently suspended funding to REGROW in April 2024. By November 2024, the project was officially terminated at the request of the Tanzanian government. In a statement published on its website, the Oakland Institute urged the Tanzanian government to reconsider its plans for the expansion of Ruaha and to provide compensation to villagers for the cattle that were confiscated and the fines they incurred from TANAPA. According to the executive director of the organization, both – the government and the World Bank must be held responsible for the damage inflicted due to their neglect of fundamental human rights, all in the pursuit of boosting tourism revenue.

24 to 48 Hours: Nigeria Automates Electronic Visa Process,https://eturbonews.com/24-to-48-hours-nigeria-automates-electronic-visa-process/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 27, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Nigeria’s Interior Minister Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo announced the automation of the country’s electronic visa approval and issuance system, aiming to enhance efficiency and draw in a greater number of tourists and business travelers. This initiative also seeks to reduce lengthy wait times at Nigerian airports and eliminate challenges posed by intermediaries who assist travelers in managing Nigerian bureaucratic procedures. “The proposed visa policy aims to enhance the ease of doing business, boost tourism, and strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations with other countries,” Tunji-Ojo wrote on X. The minister said that the policy was implemented after a discussion with Princess Zahrah Mustapha Audu, the director-general of the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council. According to the official, the updated system will allow travelers to submit their visa applications online and obtain visa approvals within 24 to 48 hours. Upon approval, electronic visas will be dispatched directly to applicants via email, eliminating the necessity for a physical visa sticker upon arrival. UN-Tourism Gives Hope for Nigeria’s Tourism Potential United Nations Tourism delegates concluded a one-week technical assessment mission in Ekiti State, Nigeria. The delegates were seen waving goodbye at the airport, signaling the end of a comprehensive visit aimed at evaluating and enhancing the state’s tourism potential. Earlier reports that Nigeria was set to terminate its Visa-on-Arrival program drew varied responses from investors and the global community. Nevertheless, the minister has assured that the policy is still operational, now enhanced with additional security measures, such as pre-arrival clearance through Interpol and other background verification systems. According to Audu, the updated system serves as an enhancement rather than a replacement for Nigeria’s existing Visa-on-Arrival program, which continues to function. Since the inauguration of President Bola Tinubu in May 2023, the administration has focused on refining the visa processing system for foreign nationals and streamlining passport issuance for Nigerian citizens. This initiative includes the establishment of a contactless passport application system for Nigerians residing abroad.

For the first time, the EAC Secretariat will have its own stand at the ITB Convention, located at Messedamm, Berlin, which is recognized as the largest tourism trade fair in the world. This event is scheduled to occur from March 4th to 6th of this year. East African States Set for Tourist Product Diversification The East African regional tourism ministers are targeting diversification of tourist products through a joint marketing and promotion to attract more tourists to the region. By presenting itself as a unified tourism destination, the EAC will highlight its varied attractions under the campaign “Visit East Africa: Feel the Vibe.” The EAC Secretary General, Ms. Veronica Nduva, has confirmed the regional bloc’s participation, emphasizing that the EAC’s presence at this prominent tourism exhibition is a strategic move to establish the East African region as a premier global tourism destination. The regional bloc of East Africa seeks to draw international tourists and investors by showcasing the area’s rich cultural heritage, stunning natural landscapes, and distinctive attractions, as stated by Nduva. East African nations boast a wealth of tourist attractions and captivating sites, offering a diverse array of experiences for travelers. This region serves as a natural habitat for some of the world’s most renowned wildlife species, including the Big Five, which consistently draw visitors from across the globe. The African elephant, lion, rhinoceros, buffalo, and leopard, collectively known as the “Big Five,” are among the most sought-after wildlife species, enticing international tourists to explore East Africa. Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa, stands out as a premier tourist destination, attracting visitors worldwide. Additionally, the Serengeti Great Migration, a remarkable natural phenomenon where millions of wildebeest traverse between Kenya and Tanzania, remains a significant highlight of the region’s tourism heritage. The vibrant cities of East Africa, along with its welcoming populace and diverse ethnic communities, further contribute to its status as an essential travel destination. Home – The World of ITB The World of ITB Participation in ITB Berlin will provide an opportunity to showcase East Africa’s multi-destination tourism offerings and cross-border experiences. International travelers will have the opportunity to discover seamless travel options throughout the region, characterized by stunning natural landscapes, pristine beaches along the Indian Ocean, and rich cultural traditions. The East African Community (EAC) aims to illustrate the region’s capacity to deliver an unforgettable travel experience for tourists from around the world. Exhibitors representing each nation in East Africa are anticipated to engage with buyers from global travel markets, thereby enhancing connections with international travel trade partners. The East African Community (EAC) will also facilitate a forum to explore sustainable tourism trends and collaborative marketing initiatives as it unveils the “Visit East Africa: Feel the Vibe” brand. Tourism continues to play a vital role in the region’s economy, contributing significantly to foreign exchange revenues and generating employment opportunities. By presenting itself as a cohesive entity at ITB Berlin, the EAC seeks to boost international tourist arrivals and promote sustainable tourism practices. This strategy is in line with the EAC’s overarching goal of standardizing services among member states, ensuring a consistently high-quality experience for all visitors. According to Ms. Nduva, the EAC has fully rebounded from the effects of Covid-19 regarding tourism figures, with the region recording approximately 8.5 million international tourist arrivals in 2024, surpassing the pre-Covid-19 figure of 7.7 million arrivals in 2019. She also noted that through the promotion of the “Visit East Africa: Feel the Vibe” tourism brand, alongside national tourism initiatives, the EAC aims to achieve over 11 million tourist arrivals by the conclusion of 2027. The Chairman of the East Africa Tourism Platform, Mr. Fred Odek Odhiambo, emphasized the critical importance of the East African Community’s (EAC) involvement, describing it as a historic milestone that will significantly enhance the region’s tourism sector on the global stage. “With the initiative ‘Visit East Africa: Feel the Vibe,’ we aim to highlight not only the unmatched beauty and cultural diversity of our region but also to strengthen East Africa’s position as a cohesive, multi-destination experience,” he stated. The newly launched EAC tourism brand, “Visit East Africa: Feel the Vibe,” is intended to promote the East African region as a unified tourist destination and an emerging hub for tourism investment in Africa. Mr. Odhiambo further remarked that this represents a crucial opportunity for the world to experience the full vibrancy of East Africa. “We anticipate establishing significant partnerships that will foster sustainable tourism development and investment throughout the region,” he added. The promotion of regional tourism under the “Visit East Africa: Feel the Vibe” brand, including participation at ITB, is backed by the European Union through the LIFTED project. LIFTED (Leveraging Integration Frameworks for Trade in Services and Civil Society Organizations in the EAC) is a project co-financed by the European Union (EU) and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The objective of LIFTED is to enhance EAC, continental, and bilateral trade with the EU in services and civil society engagement, all within the framework of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to promote people-centered integration in the EAC. The project is executed by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) of Germany in partnership with the EAC Secretariat.

IATA: Global Airline Industry Safety Took a Step Back in 2024,https://eturbonews.com/iata-global-airline-industry-safety-took-a-step-back-in-2024/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 26, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"According to the 2024 Annual Safety Report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation sector demonstrated another year of commendable safety performance, with improvements noted in several key metrics over the five-year average; however, it experienced a decline from the outstanding results achieved in 2023. IATA The International Air Transport Association (IATA) represents and serves airlines with advocacy and global standards for safety, security, efficiency and sustainability. The overall accident rate stood at 1.13 per million flights (equating to one accident for every 880,000 flights), which is an improvement over the five-year average of 1.25, yet not as favorable as the 1.09 recorded in 2023. In 2024, there were seven fatal accidents among a total of 40.6 million flights, an increase from the single fatal accident reported in 2023 and above the five-year average of five fatal accidents. The total number of on-board fatalities in 2024 reached 244, a significant rise from the 72 fatalities in 2023 and the five-year average of 144. Despite this increase, the fatality risk remained low at 0.06, which is below the five-year average of 0.10, although it is double the 0.03 reported in 2023. “Even with recent high profile aviation accidents, it is important to remember that accidents are extremely rare. There were 40.6 million flights in 2024 and seven fatal accidents. Moreover, the long-term story of aviation safety is one of continuous improvement. A decade ago, the five-year average (2011-2015) was one accident for every 456,000 flights. Today, the five-year average (2020-2024) is one accident for every 810,000 flights. That improvement is because we know that every fatality is one too many. We honor the memory of every life lost in an aviation accident with our deepest sympathies and ever greater resolve to make flying even safer. And for that, the accumulation of safety data, including the 2024 safety report, is our most powerful tool,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. Walsh: New EU ETS amendments hurt aviation climate change efforts The European Union Parliament had adopted the proposed amendments to the Fit for 55 revision of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) that Key safety insights are: Increasing Risks in Conflict Zones: The recent downing of two aircraft in conflict areas (one in Kazakhstan resulting in 38 fatalities and another in Sudan with five fatalities) has highlighted the critical need for the Safer Skies initiative. This initiative was established following the PS752 tragedy to implement protective measures in high-risk airspace. Prevalent Types of Accidents: In 2024, tail strikes and runway excursions emerged as the most commonly reported accidents, emphasizing the necessity for stringent safety protocols during take-off and landing. Importantly, there were no incidents of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). Airlines participating in the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), which includes all IATA member airlines, reported an accident rate of 0.92 per million flights. This figure is significantly lower than the 1.70 accident rate observed among non-IOSA carriers. Accidents and incidents occurring in conflict zones are classified as security-related events and are therefore excluded from this report. Although these incidents do not feature in the safety data presented, they, along with the increasing occurrences of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interference, represent a significant concern for aviation safety that necessitates immediate global collaboration. “No civil aircraft should ever be a target—deliberate or accidental—of military operations. Governments must step up, enhance intelligence-sharing, and establish clearer global protocols to prevent such tragedies and safeguard civilian aviation,” said Walsh. Regional Safety Performance North America : In 2024, the region experienced 12 accidents, resulting in an improvement of the all-accident rate from 1.53 per million sectors in 2023 to 1.20. This figure is also lower than the five-year average of 1.26. Notably, the fatality risk has remained at zero since 2020. The predominant types of accidents reported in 2024 were tail strikes, followed by incidents of runway damage and excursions. Although no accidents have been attributed to debris from space operations, the rising frequency of rocket launches poses challenges for air traffic management. Asia-Pacific : The region recorded seven accidents in 2024, leading to an increase in the all-accident rate from 0.92 per million sectors in 2023 to 1.04 in 2024, although it remains below the five-year regional average of 1.10. The fatality risk remained stable at 0.15, unchanged from the previous year. There was no single predominant type of accident, with occurrences including tail strikes, runway damage, and turbulence, among others. Africa : In 2024, the region reported 10 accidents, causing the all-accident rate to rise from 8.36 per million sectors in 2023 to 10.59, surpassing the five-year average of 8.46. Africa (AFI) recorded the highest accident rate, yet the fatality risk remained at zero for the second consecutive year. The most frequently reported accident types included runway excursions and issues related to landing gear. Notably, 40% of all accidents involving AFI-based operators occurred with turboprop aircraft. The IATA Focus Africa initiative, through the Collaborative Aviation Safety Improvement Program (CASIP), continues to mobilize resources to tackle significant safety challenges. Middle East and North Africa : The region experienced two accidents in 2024, resulting in an improvement of the all-accident rate from 1.12 accidents per million sectors in 2023 to 1.08 in 2024, which is also better than the five-year average of 1.09. The fatality risk has remained at zero since 2019. While no accidents were linked to GNSS interference, this issue has emerged as a significant concern in the region. Commonwealth of Independent States : In 2024, the region experienced no accidents, resulting in a significant improvement in the all-accident rate, which decreased from 1.05 accidents per million sectors in 2023 to zero. This marks a notable enhancement compared to the five-year average of 2.49. The fatality risk has consistently remained at zero since 2022. However, concerns regarding GNSS interference and security threats associated with regional conflicts continue to pose challenges to aviation safety in the area. It is important to clarify that the downing of an Azerbaijan Airlines aircraft in a conflict zone in December 2024 is not included in this safety report’s accident classification. Additionally, the CIS has limited data on accidents, which may lead to more significant revisions once further information is obtained, potentially impacting both the accident rate and fatality risk calculations. Europe : In 2024, the region recorded nine accidents, leading to a slight increase in the all-accident rate from 0.95 per million sectors in 2023 to 1.02. This figure aligns with the five-year average accident rate of 1.02 for the region. The fatality risk rate rose from zero in 2023 to 0.03 in 2024. The majority of accidents were attributed to tail strikes, followed by runway excursions. North Asia : The region reported one accident in 2024, resulting in a minor increase in the all-accident rate from zero accidents per million sectors in 2023 to 0.13. This rate is an improvement over the five-year average of 0.16 accidents per million sectors. The fatality risk has remained at zero since 2022. The sole accident involving North Asian-based operators was related to a tail strike. Latin America and the Caribbean : In 2024, the region experienced five accidents, causing the all-accident rate to rise from 0.73 accidents per million sectors in 2023 to 1.77. This figure is an improvement compared to the five-year average of 2.00. The fatality risk increased from 0.00 in 2023 to 0.35 in 2024, with the majority of accidents being linked to tail strikes. Enhancing Safety Through Prompt, Thorough, and Publicly Accessible Accident Reports Inadequate or delayed accident reports hinder essential stakeholders—including operators, manufacturers, regulators, and infrastructure providers—from obtaining crucial insights that could enhance aviation safety. An analysis conducted by IATA on accident investigations from 2018 to 2023 indicates that merely 57% of these reports were finalized and published in accordance with the requirements set forth by the Chicago Convention. The rates of report completion exhibit considerable variation across different regions, with North Asia achieving the highest rate at 75%, followed by North America at 70% and Europe at 66%. The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) follows closely at 65%, while the Middle East and North Africa report a completion rate of 60%. Latin America and the Caribbean stand at 57%, Asia-Pacific at 53%, and Africa significantly lags behind at 20%. “Accident investigation is a vital tool for improving global aviation safety. To be effective, the reports of accident investigations must be complete, accessible, and timely. Annex 13 of the Chicago Convention is clear that this is a state’s obligation. Burying accident reports for political considerations is completely unacceptable. And if capacity is the blocker, then we need a coordinated global effort to provide technical support to countries with limited accident investigation expertise,” said Walsh. Significant Increase in GNSS Interference Represents Escalating Threat to Aviation Safety Data from the IATA Incident Data Exchange (IDX) indicates a notable rise in GNSS-related interference, which has the potential to compromise aircraft navigation systems. Although various backup systems are available to enhance aviation safety during such disruptions, these occurrences still present intentional and unacceptable hazards to civil aviation. The highest levels of GNSS interference have been reported in Türkiye, Iraq, and Egypt. Between 2023 and 2024, reports of GNSS interference—including signal disruptions, jamming, and spoofing—experienced a dramatic increase. The rate of interference rose by 175%, while incidents of GPS spoofing surged by 500%. “The sharp rise in GNSS interference events is deeply concerning. Reliable navigation is fundamental to safe and efficient flight operations. Immediate steps by governments and air navigation service providers are needed to stop this practice, improve situational awareness, and ensure that airlines have the necessary tools to operate safely in all areas,” said Walsh.

In recent times hotels, airlines, and travel websites have experienced numerous cyber-attacks and according to digital travel company, Booking.com, there has been a 900% increase in travel scams, primarily driven by the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by criminals. Experts add that the problem is compounded by a limited use of threat protection mechanisms by online users, sometimes because they have limited awareness of the extent of the threat. With this in mind Dr. Campbell implied that “perhaps the regulatory system ought to contemplate that as well.” Against this background, Dr. Campbell says: “The threat of cybercrime looms large for tourism in states that are already quite vulnerable.” “And part of the problem is that cybercrimes have obviously damaged trust and puts the reputation of the tourism sector at risk, and we can’t afford that especially in small island developing states.” She also argued that the Caribbean has a large number of American and European visitors, intensifying the risk and the consequences in the event of a breach. Dr. Campbell outlined that governments, by investing in a robust and resilient architecture, can improve protection for the tourism sector against cybercrimes, including “a zero-tolerance approach, place emphasis on contingency planning, tough penalties for serious breaches, continuously build out technical skills and build human resource capacity.” Visit Jamaica | The best music, food, vistas and vibes for your perfect vacation Discover the beauty of Jamaica with its fascinating culture, stunning beaches and lush landscapes.

She noted that cybersecurity has become increasingly important as technological innovation continues to move at a rapid pace, causing tourism businesses to rely more on technology. Dr. Campbell said this “has made the tourism sector increasingly reliant on and made to be more efficient as a result of this technology, but this technology also makes the tourism sector extremely susceptible to cybercrime.” Dr. Campbell highlighted several forms of cybercrime and reminded her international audience that “the motivation is not always commercial. Cybercrimes could be politically motivated as well and it makes the picture more complicated in terms of coming up with a formidable and robust regulatory architecture.

Speaking at the Global Tourism Resilience Conference yesterday during a panel on “Harnessing, Generative Artificial Intelligence for Tourism Resilience,” the Director of Tourism highlighted, “Since its emergence, the tourism industry has utilized AI to improve features like customer experience, reduce costs, and streamline operations – and it has been transforming the industry. However… “…the human element of travel is irreplaceable.” “Only humans can provide insights into particularities like the best time to visit a location for an excursion, who at the hotel mixes the best drinks or offer the best rates through personal contacts. AI cannot pick up on these complexities.” The panel featured several industry experts in AI and focused on the transformative impact of AI in fortifying the tourism sector against various challenges. It also looked at how AI technologies can be leveraged to enhance predictive analytics and automate customer service. The 3rd Global Tourism Resilience, taking place from February 17-19 at Princess Grand in Negril, features keynote speeches, panel discussions, and workshops centered around navigating challenges and leveraging opportunities in the tourism sector.

Their apprehensions stem from Bradbury’s testimony during a hearing last week, where family members expressed concerns that he had actively worked to obstruct the implementation of a Congressionally mandated Safety Management System for Boeing while serving at the DOT during the initial Trump administration. The establishment of such a safety system could have potentially prevented the two tragic Boeing 737 MAX8 crashes in 2018 and 2019, which resulted in the loss of 346 lives.

On February 24, 2025, the families reached out to Senator John Thune (R-S.D.), the Senate Majority Leader, requesting a meeting to address the issues raised during last Thursday’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. They expressed their worry that Bradbury, who held a position at the DOT during the first Trump administration, failed to secure vital information requested by Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) concerning the two Boeing crashes, despite having a legal team of 500 members at his disposal. The families also contacted Senators Wicker, Daniel Sullivan (R-Ala.), Shelley Capito (R-Va.), and Gerald Moran (R-Ks.). Nadia Milleron of Massachusetts, who tragically lost her daughter Samya Rose Stumo, 24, in the second Boeing crash in Ethiopia, remarked, “Bradbury’s statement to the Senate, ‘We have the safest air system in the world, but we cannot fall down on the job,’ reflects a complete insensitivity to the 84 individuals who have perished in plane crashes across the United States in just the past month.” Department of Transportation To improve the quality of life for all American people and communities, from rural to urban, and to increase the productivity and competitiveness of American workers and businesses. Bradbury held various positions within the first Trump administration at the Department of Transportation, including acting deputy secretary, acting secretary, and Senate-confirmed general counsel, where he was responsible for overseeing a team of 500 attorneys and legal personnel. He was appointed as Acting Secretary of Transportation on January 11, following Elaine Chao’s resignation, and Sean Duffy was sworn in as Secretary on January 28.

ITA Airways and Lufthansa Combine Routes Through Codesharing,https://eturbonews.com/ita-airways-and-lufthansa-combine-routes-through-codesharing/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 25, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"ITA Airways and the Lufthansa Group are enhancing their collaboration to benefit their customers. For the first time, the route networks of ITA Airways and the other airlines within the Lufthansa Group will be interconnected through mutual code sharing, allowing for seamless integration in a single booking. With the launch of sales today, over 100 new codeshare connections will be available for booking through both ITA Airways and the Lufthansa Group (including Lufthansa, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Air Dolomiti) for flights commencing with the summer 2025 schedule. Lufthansa Frequent Flyer Points Now on ITA Airways The integration of ITA Airways into the Lufthansa Group continues to advance significantly. Members of the Miles & More program now have the opportunity By incorporating codeshare flight numbers into existing itineraries, customers will enjoy a broader selection of flights and increased flexibility.

Additionally, members of the Miles & More or Volare loyalty programs will have the opportunity to earn and redeem miles or points on codeshare flights.

With a single booking, a customer of the Lufthansa Group can access synchronized connecting flights operated by ITA Airways under its airline’s flight numbers. Codesharing will enhance and standardize the travel experience for all passengers at the Lufthansa Group’s hubs. The swift integration of ITA Airways into the Lufthansa Group is yielding significant benefits for our shared customers through code sharing.” With the commencement of the summer flight schedule on 30 March 2025, certain flights operated by ITA Airways will also be designated with flight numbers from Lufthansa, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, or Brussels Airlines. This includes both year-round domestic flights within Italy from Rome-Fiumicino and international services connecting Rome to Malta, Athens, Sofia, and Tirana. For the first time, Lufthansa Group customers will have the opportunity to book flights to ITA Airways destinations such as Alghero (Sardinia), Pantelleria (Sicily), and Reggio di Calabria. Furthermore, flight codes will be assigned to ITA Airways services operating between Italy and other Lufthansa Group hubs. For instance, under the new summer flight schedule, a Lufthansa customer can reserve a journey from Frankfurt to Rome with flight number LH236 and subsequently connect to an ITA Airways flight from Rome to Brindisi, designated as LH5078. This arrangement provides an additional travel option to the existing Lufthansa Group connections to Brindisi.

Legoland Johor Bahru: The real meaning of “sustainability”?,https://eturbonews.com/legoland-johor-bahru-the-real-meaning-of-sustainability/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 25, 2025",N/A,Imtiaz Muqbil,"The term “sustainability” often evokes conventional imagery associated with nature, such as lush landscapes, clean air, forests, seas, and mountains. However, I recently uncovered its more profound significance. This revelation did not occur in a nature reserve, an innovative urban environment, a hiking path, or a wellness retreat. Instead, it took place at Legoland, the first of its kind in Asia, located in Johor Bahru at the southernmost point of the Malay Peninsula. True sustainability is reflected in our treatment of children—the future generation that we profess to cherish deeply. Authentic sustainability manifests in the sight of numerous children joyfully engaging with one another in a safe and nurturing environment that fosters their growth, learning, and coexistence. In an atmosphere of peace, harmony, and innocent camaraderie. A vibrant space filled with the soothing sounds of laughter, children eagerly lining up for a “driving lesson” or racing down water slides, savoring ice cream cones, and exclaiming with delight at every twist and turn of a roller coaster. There are no reservations, no biases, no hidden motives, no divisions, and no obstacles. Awesome Awaits | LEGOLAND® Malaysia Resort Explore Theme Park, Water Park, Aquarium & Hotel in a unique LEGO® themed destination at LEGOLAND® Malaysia Resort. Awesome Awaits. Book Now. Individuals from diverse backgrounds—Arabs, Chinese, Russians, Indians, ASEAN members, and Europeans—communicate in a multitude of languages. They are joined by family members, including some elderly grandparents from our aging society. This represents a form of tourism that is sustainable, responsible, meaningful, and regenerative all at once. At Legoland, a true Darussalaam, which translates to “Abode of Peace” in Arabic. Beyond the enjoyment and entertainment, children engage for hours in deciphering riddles, making connections, solving puzzles, and exploring nature and culture. A setting devoid of aggressive superheroes and intimidating dinosaurs. An opportunity to reassess the significance of time. To revitalize and refresh oneself, far surpassing the benefits of any spa or wellness retreat. My wife and I enjoyed two tranquil days with our grandsons, both aged 11. While the children played energetically, my wife engaged in reading or took a restful nap. I was able to accomplish a considerable amount of work, coining a new phrase: “Work from Legoland.” Upon our return home, our son and daughter-in-law had three days to address their backlog and realign their lives. It was a collective celebration of childhood, parenthood, and grandparenthood—creating invaluable memories to treasure for a lifetime. Truly a transformative and pivotal experience. We gained new insights. One exhibit detailed the history of Legoland, tracing its origins back to 1932 as a wooden toy manufacturer in Denmark. From an environmental perspective, recycling bins were abundantly available. Socially, a majority of women donned modest swimwear, including not only Muslims but also individuals from Chinese, Indian, and Caucasian backgrounds. The theme park also serves as a promoter of ASEAN integration, showcasing miniature replicas of significant historical and cultural landmarks from all ASEAN nations within a single pavilion, accompanied by clear and accessible interpretations. From a commercial perspective, Legoland operates as a seasonal attraction, experiencing significant fluctuations in visitor numbers during non-holiday periods. This situation presents numerous opportunities to enhance the business in alignment with current societal, demographic, and travel trends. Traveling with family and catering to an aging population are increasingly popular. Legoland and Johor Bahru have the potential to become a central hub for these demographics. Regular forums and conferences could be organized to discuss emerging trends and experiences related to these themes, potentially in collaboration with local, regional, and global children’s organizations to raise funds for the millions of children in distress worldwide. I am confident that sponsors would be eager to offer their support. Campaigns aimed at family reunions and bonding could be initiated through special passes available for weekdays and off-peak times. Additionally, more comprehensive packages could be developed to include other destinations in Malaysia, as well as Singapore and the Indonesian islands of Bintan and Batam, which are conveniently accessible by ferry. As the first Legoland in Asia, such innovative and comprehensive campaigns would align seamlessly with Malaysia’s chairmanship of ASEAN in 2025, followed by the Visit Malaysia 2026 initiative. They will enhance tourism in Malaysia, foster socio-cultural integration within ASEAN, and support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). Crucially, they will assist families and communities, as well as the broader Travel & Tourism sector, in recognizing the significance of peace, harmony, and coexistence. It is essential to view this from a child’s perspective, rather than through the lens of political or business leaders, or bureaucrats from the UN or government. If this approach proves effective, a rapid economic boom may ensue. Numerous new housing units, condominiums, and various types of “development” are already emerging. Plans for infrastructure improvements are underway to enhance cross-border travel from neighboring Singapore. Calls for equilibrium are echoing globally. If Legoland and Johor Bahru can successfully implement this strategy, it could become a remarkable success story in the realms of tourism and national development.

Tanzania Hosts Regional UN Tourism Gastronomy Forum,https://eturbonews.com/tanzania-hosts-regional-un-tourism-gastronomy-forum/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 25, 2025",N/A,Apolinari Tairo - eTN Tanzania,"The United Nations Tourism Organization, in collaboration with the Basque Culinary Center and the Government of Tanzania, is set to host the Second UN Tourism Regional Forum on Gastronomy Tourism for Africa from April 23 to 25 in Arusha, a prominent tourist city in northern Tanzania. This forum aims to gather over 300 delegates from across Africa and beyond, focusing on the significance of food tourism in fostering economic development and safeguarding Africa’s cultural heritage. Gastronomy tourism, often referred to as culinary or food tourism, emphasizes the exploration of a destination through its culinary offerings, including its food and beverages. This sector of tourism has been on the rise, encompassing a range of activities such as cooking classes, food festivals, and visits to local markets. It aims to promote economic and social development, preserve cultural heritage, and stimulate local economies through the utilization of agricultural products and local cuisine. Event’s guests will include high-ranking officials from the United World Tourism (UNWTO), tourism ministers from UNWTO member states in Africa, and representatives from the African Union. The conference will include a range of activities, such as live cooking demonstrations conducted by esteemed local chefs, tastings of food and beverages, as well as discussions focused on emerging opportunities within the realm of food tourism. Attendees at the Second Regional Gastronomy Forum will share their experiences, deliberate on strategies, and cultivate creativity aimed at enhancing food tourism across Africa. Dr. Pindi Chana, Tanzania’s Minister for Tourism and Natural Resources, has urged key stakeholders in the tourism sector, including caterers, to engage in the event to capitalize on the diverse opportunities presented by culinary offerings in the development of tourism. The Gastronomy Forum is expected to highlight traditional and natural foods, with officials from the UNWTO underscoring the potential to present Africa’s diverse flavors to a global audience. UN Tourism | Bringing the world closer UN Tourism is the United Nations agency responsible for the promotion of responsible, sustainable and universally accessible tourism “Our goal is to build the capacity of local chefs and diversify Tanzanian cuisine as to offer tourists an authentic culinary experience. Through this event, we also seek to explore investment opportunities that will boost gastronomy tourism in our country”, said the Tanzanian tourism minister. “We are honored to host this forum, which will allow us to learn from global leaders in food tourism,” Dr. Chana said. “We are aiming to make this a historic event that highlights the richness of Tanzania’s indigenous cuisines and their potential to boost local economies,” Chana said. The upcoming Regional Forum is set to convene various destinations alongside international experts to examine the transformative capabilities of Gastronomy Tourism. By facilitating knowledge exchange and the dissemination of best practices, this forum seeks to leverage the advantages of gastronomy tourism for the enhancement of local communities and the environment, thereby promoting regional unity and resilience. The Tanzanian Minister of Tourism emphasized that adopting a strategic approach to tourism development continues to be a primary objective within the UNWTO strategies aimed at influencing global tourism policies, advancing sustainable tourism, and encouraging economic growth. “We are excited to showcase these local foods and eagerly anticipate introducing other flavoring foods from neighboring countries in the African region,” the Tanzanian Tourism Minister said. UN Tourism has been committed to promote Africa as a viable and attractive tourism destination with gastronomy tourism increasing as an aspect of that effort, she said. “UN Tourism is dedicated to positioning Africa among a vibrant, accessible and diverse tourism destination. Gastronomy is an integral part of this. We want to encourage Tanzania to use all available platforms to promote this forum, including collaborating with renowned chefs and influential public figures who specialize in African cuisine,” she said. UNWTO’s Regional Director for Africa, Ms. Elcia Grandcourt, stated during the press briefing that the forthcoming forum will not only present Tanzania’s abundant and varied culinary offerings but will also emphasize the gastronomic traditions from various parts of the African continent. Grandcourt emphasized that adopting a strategic approach to gastronomy is essential for enhancing tourism growth, which has become a pivotal aspect of global tourism policies aimed at promoting sustainable practices and stimulating economic development through tourism in Africa. She noted that Tanzania previously hosted the Regional Commission for Africa meeting in 2022 and is now poised to host another significant UNWTO event. Grandcourt reiterated that the upcoming forum will serve to highlight Tanzania’s rich culinary diversity while also showcasing Africa’s gastronomy. She affirmed the UNWTO’s commitment to ensuring the forum’s success and underscored its importance in establishing Africa’s culinary scene as a prominent attraction for international travelers. Despite Africa’s rich and diverse gastronomic heritage, it remains largely underappreciated by tourists. Tanzania Targets More Tourists From Non-Traditional Markets Through diversification of tourist visiting sites and searching for new markets, Tanzania is targeting to intensify its tourism marketing in new tourist sources in South America, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa other than the traditional European and the United States markets. Tanzania has been selected to host this year’s forum following the successful inaugural edition held in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, in July 2024. This choice underscores Tanzania’s strategic initiatives to incorporate its rich and varied food culture into its tourism sector, thereby reinforcing its role as a significant contributor to Africa’s culinary tourism scene. The event is a joint initiative involving Tanzania’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, the UN Tourism Organisation, and the Basque Culinary Centre. Emphasizing economic development, cultural preservation, and community empowerment, the forum will investigate how gastronomy can promote sustainable tourism growth across Africa. Over the course of three days, the event will include a variety of expert-led discussions, panel sessions, and master classes that will examine the pivotal role of gastronomy in the advancement of tourism. Attendees will engage in insightful exchanges regarding the economic potential of food in tourism development, the cultural significance of African cuisine, and strategies to utilize Africa’s diverse culinary offerings to entice international visitors to experience African gastronomy. The upcoming Gastronomy Forum is anticipated to foster discussions that will enhance the global recognition of African gastronomy. Tanzania is recognized as one of the African nations rich in varied tourist attractions. The country is poised to highlight the richness of African culinary traditions while fostering new avenues for tourism and economic development. The Tanzanian Minister of Tourism has reiterated the strong support from the UNWTO to ensure the success of the Gastronomy Forum in meeting its objectives, emphasizing the importance of elevating Africa’s cuisine as a significant draw for international visitors. The forthcoming UN Tourism Regional Forum on Gastronomy Tourism for Africa is anticipated to convene prominent destinations and global experts to examine the transformative possibilities offered by gastronomy tourism.

Mr. Bartlett revealed: “We’re now talking to the UDC (Urban Development Corporation) about the township of Rose Hall that I want to become what I call the Tourism Innovation Town, which will be the first one of its kind anywhere in the Caribbean.” The concept is to include housing, public services, light industrial, and commercial development on lands opposite the John Rollins Success Primary School. It will also facilitate the relocation of the Barrett Town Police Station and an upgraded health center to a mini hospital to be more accessible and better able to cater to the needs of more than 40,000 residents and some 20,000 tourists. As Member of Parliament, Minister Bartlett also plans “to build the school system by rationalizing primary education with the school in the constituency and also build out early childhood education facilities to create the first early childhood innovation center.” The center will cater to 100 students at a time equipped with tablets with their parents also attending “so they will understand what the child is doing to go back home and be able to help the child to develop.” Presenting it as a different type of education, he said it was one in which knowledge was garnered, but more importantly, focused on how that knowledge is used and converted into practical and material things with value. Minister Bartlett outlined his plan for the communities at the presentation of titles to 37 occupants of lots in Grange Pen by the Housing Agency of Jamaica at the Lilliput Community Centre on Friday. A total of 535 families are in line to get their titles upon payment of outstanding balances on the $500,000 purchase cost. So far, the Tourism Enhancement Fund (TEF) has spent $964 million upgrading the Grange Pen community, and 1635 units are to be built in this phase of the development. The community of Barrett Hall, which also lies along the Elegant Corridor of the tourism belt, will also be having infrastructural improvement during the new fiscal year, and 1500 more housing units to be built by the National Housing Trust, starting this year while the nearby community of Spot Valley is to get 585 units. Stating that the government was not only building houses for workers in the tourism sector, Minister Bartlett said it was also building the source for employment and income. Underscoring the benefit of tourism to the people of St James, Minister Bartlett credited infrastructural improvements that have enhanced the communities of Flanker, Norwood, Lilliput and Grange Pen “to tourism money doing all of these.” Visit Jamaica | The best music, food, vistas and vibes for your perfect vacation Discover the beauty of Jamaica with its fascinating culture, stunning beaches and lush landscapes.

Some are blaming the current monetary rate of exchange as the reason behind the travel cancellations; however, the Canadian dollar has been worth less than the American dollar since 2014, and has continued to decline since then. Therefore, concluding that the value of the Loonie to the US dollar is not the likely reason behind cancellations of trips, that were already made, nor trips that are normally taken but are no longer on the Canadian travel agenda. According to the US Travel Association, if Canada travel to America achieves a 10% reduction, this would translate into 2 million less Canada-USA tourists which would result in 14,000 job losses and lost spending in the amount of US$2.1 billion.

In a report by The Star, she informed the venue she will not be able to honor her commitment due to recent changes within the organization imposed by President Trump including his takeover of the Center and declarations that there are only two biological genders and any diversity is illegal and immoral. Rheaume was quoted as saying: “We don’t have the same politics and values, let’s put it that way. For me to travel across the border into the U.S. … I’m a queer, Métis person — those two things alone — (Trump’s) already proven in so many overt and covert ways that I’m sure he wouldn’t be receptive.” What Canadians Themselves are Saying Says Douglas Proudfoot, dit Scott @DSProudfoot (first addressing how Canada spells versus the US): Travellers, not travelers. And cancelled, not canceled. But yeah, not going there. Carlo Tarini said to The Post, his family has swapped their April vacation from New York City to the Bahamas. “We’re mad as hell, and we’re not going to take it anymore.” For the Tarini family, the US is wiped off the map for the next four years as far as travel is concerned. Tour Operator Reports Alarming Cancellations Kristine Geary, the owner of Maple Leaf Tours, which has been a family run business for over 30 years and sells packaged group travel, told The Post she is estimating 40% cancellations to the US representing hundred of thousands of lost dollars for her company alone. She stated: “It’s taken a turn for the worse across the industry. I’ve never seen this.” Airlines are Listening WestJet has said they are considering slashing their US flights this spring by around 25%, all because the demand for air travel to America has been consistently sliding downward with the new US presidential administration. The top five states that will likely be in the immediate line of cancellation fire are California, Nevada, Texas, Florida, and New York – Canadians’ most faovirte US states to visit. Even by vehicle, the number of cars returning from the US back into Canada has decreased since January by around 15,000. The last time there was such a significant drop was when COVID reared it’s ugly head. What Half of America Thinks Less than 2 months into office, even Trump supporters are regretting their vote for the current US President. Two hashtags are currently dominating Donald’s decisions, statements, and actions so far: #MAGAregrets “All I can say is I was a dumb a$$ voting for Trump only because of my beliefs. People around me encouraged it. I can think for myself, yes, but I thought at the time that was the better choice. Now I’m looking at it, with everything going on, is the worst, THE WORST decision I ever made. … I totally regret this. I shouldn’t have voted at all.” – MAGA Cult Slayer BFHoodrich posted this social media video that summarizes so many Trump vote regrets. @i on X #MAGAregrets #BoycottUSA How sad for Americans to see a growing hashtag of BoycottUSA. Perhaps Troys Voice, a social media poster from Australia, sums it up best of all: “In case you don’t hear it on Twitter or in the mainstream media, there is a huge movement right now, across the world, to boycott things made in the USA. It’s mainly on TikTok. Here are some of my motivations for joining it. “Let me clarify: My decision to join the worldwide boycott of things made in the USA does not reflect my feelings towards the people of the USA but rather my feelings against the government of the USA. I have read many comments from citizens from within the USA itself understanding the boycott, encouraging it, even joining it. It’s their voices that I want to amplify because ultimately, victory will come from the American people yourselves. “And if you voted for Donald Trump or did not vote at all, those facts do not matter. What matters now are our actions now, and those actions can include joining those of us who want to resist through peaceful means – just peaceful means – the aberrant acts of the USA government and, increasingly, the abhorrent acts of the USA government. “And if you voted for Donald Trump as some sort of Messiah, but you’re now having niggling doubts, then continue to explore those doubts, and consider seriously our view that Donald Trump is a false Messiah. But if you are a MAGA American through and through, then I know that you do not care what I have to say. And finally, we reach common ground: because my capacity to hear from MAGA America is spent; it’s exhausted. I have become overloaded by Donald Trump’s deflections, his misdirections, his manipulations, his falsehoods and false prophecies. “So let us part ways now with as much kindness to each other as we can muster. Have your say, but please have it somewhere else. Take care of yourselves, as I know you will, while the rest of us take care of each other.” US President Trump makes Canadians Vacation in Mexico – No Tariff Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, is asking fellow Canadians to avoid vacationing in the United States. Others say Mexico is warm and beautiful and a to-go destination for Canadian holiday seekers. This anti-tourism verbiage responded to a 25% tariff forced upon Canada by US President Donald Trump.

South Africa Calls for Pan-African Tourism Partnership,https://eturbonews.com/south-africa-calls-for-pan-african-tourism-partnership/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 24, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"African nations must establish partnerships aimed at enhancing the continent’s travel and tourism sector and fostering economic development, South Africa’s national tourism body said today. In his inaugural address at the Meetings Africa event, Greg Davids, the chairperson of the board for South African Tourism, the governmental body responsible for tourism marketing, urged African travel industry shareholders to share their narratives with the global community and to work together to advance the continent’s economies. Everything you need to know to travel to South Africa (US) From city life to adventure, wildlife to culture, breathtaking scenery to sun-soaked coasts – discover South Africa. The three-day event, which draws 410 exhibitors from 26 African nations and 300 buyers from more than 60 countries, aims to facilitate discussions among African countries on enhancing the industry, exchanging best practices, and investigating opportunities for collaboration. “Let us unite, collaborate, and create a future where Africa is recognized as a leading destination for business travel and tourism, setting a precedent for future generations. Each successful event held in Africa highlights our collective capabilities and serves as a reminder to the world that we can host world-class, secure, large-scale events that will enhance economies and improve livelihoods throughout the continent,” Davids said addressing participants of the Pan-African business and trade exhibition. Davids urged participants to leverage Meetings Africa as a platform for establishing investment partnerships that will shape the future of the continent. Africa Tourism Surges with 74 Million Visitors in 2024 The robust performance in tourism has established Africa as the second fastest-growing tourist destination globally, following the Middle East. “By fostering collaboration, embracing innovation, and sharing a common vision, we are cultivating an Africa where business events not only unite individuals but also generate enduring economic and social benefits.” “Our international buyers are more than mere attendees; they are integral to the African narrative. They will engage with visionaries, explore innovative solutions, and observe firsthand how Africa transcends traditional conference hosting to create meaningful legacies,” Davids added. According to him, the event is expected to have a significant economic impact on South Africa, highlighting that last year’s Meetings Africa resulted in a direct expenditure of $7.63 million.

Important Tips for Travel During Ramadan,https://eturbonews.com/important-tips-for-travel-during-ramadan/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 21, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Ramadan is celebrated by Muslims around the globe as a month dedicated to fasting (sawm), prayer (salah), introspection, and communal activities. This significant celebration takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and marks the anniversary of Muhammad’s initial revelation. The yearly observance of Ramadan is considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam and spans twenty-nine to thirty days, beginning with the sighting of the crescent moon and concluding with the next sighting. Fasting from dawn until sunset is a mandatory practice (fard) for all adult Muslims who do not suffer from acute or chronic illnesses, are not traveling, are elderly, breastfeeding, are diabetic, or are pregnant. It is believed that the spiritual rewards (thawab) associated with fasting are significantly enhanced during the month of Ramadan. Therefore, during the fasting hours, Muslims abstain not only from food and drink but also from tobacco, sexual relations, and any sinful actions, focusing their efforts on prayer and the study of the Quran. 10 Tips You Need To Know When Traveling During Ramadan – Muslim Pro Discover how to make the most of your travels during Ramadan with these 10 useful tips. Embrace new adventures while honoring your religious obligations, and experience a unique and rewarding journey. Stay connected to your faith and enjoy a blessed, fulfilling trip wherever you go. This year’s Muslim holy month of Ramadan is anticipated to commence on the evening of Friday, February 28 and conclude on the evening of Sunday, March 30. Throughout this period, Muslims will engage in spiritual reflection and fasting. Consequently, this observance has implications for leisure and business travel. Why visit Riyadh during Ramadan? When you visit Riyadh during the holy month, Ramadan, the adorned streets with lights and shining lanterns will greet you. Travel experts have outlined the top five considerations for Muslims planning vacations during Ramadan or arranging holidays or business trips for those who observe this sacred month: When traveling to a destination with a Muslim majority during Ramadan, one should anticipate that most dining establishments will be closed during daylight hours, and nightlife activities will generally cease for the duration of the month. In tourist-centric locations such as Dubai, restaurants and cafes typically remain operational, with the exception of local neighborhoods like Deira and Old Dubai. Hotels, on the other hand, continue their regular operations and are usually not subject to these restrictions. If you are planning business travel for Muslim employees, it is advisable to avoid scheduling during the Ramadan period. This is due to the fact that individuals observing Ramadan will be engaged in acts of charity, increased prayer activities, and spending time with family. Nevertheless, if it is necessary to arrange business travel for a Muslim employee during Ramadan, it is recommended to plan meetings and activities outside of fasting hours, while also allowing for flexibility to accommodate prayer breaks and iftar. Additionally, ensure that accommodations offer halal dining options and provide access to nearby mosques or quiet areas for prayer. Upon the conclusion of Ramadan, a period of festivity commences, making it an ideal opportunity to either indulge in a well-deserved vacation or organize an extensive journey. Consequently, the months following Ramadan are frequently chosen as a favored honeymoon period for Muslim couples. Finally, for those who aim to be considerate of individuals observing Ramadan, travel and hospitality brands must remain attentive to their Muslim clientele during this time. Modifying meal schedules to correspond with suhoor (the pre-dawn meal) and iftar (the meal to break the fast) can significantly enhance the experience, ensuring guests feel appreciated and respected. Do’s Respect those fasting by not eating or drinking in public Participate in charitable activities Learn about Ramadan traditions Attend iftar and suhoor gatherings Accept dinner (iftar) invitations from friends and neighbors Listen to music quietly on headphones or in your house Don’ts Avoid public displays of affection Dress inappropriately Disturb others with noise, especially late at night Eat too many carbohydrates and too much fat Avoid rice and pasta Consume white bread or pita bread Go for the main course immediately at Iftar Sit at the Iftar Table Without a Salad Overdo the Dessert Other considerations Don’t try to force anyone to fast with you Don’t complain about being hungry or thirsty Don’t use the month as an excuse to slack off at work Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

Jamaica Palladium Hotel Groundbreaking Hailed by Tourism Industry,https://eturbonews.com/jamaica-palladium-hotel-groundbreaking-hailed-by-tourism-industry/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 21, 2025",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony in Hanover recently, Prime Minister Holness underscored the project’s alignment with the administration’s ASPIRE growth agenda and its broader vision for economic sustainability. “This expansion project aligns seamlessly with our new national pivot towards robust and inclusive growth. For most of the last decade, we have as a country focused on fiscal consolidation and debt reduction. The scale and speed of Jamaica’s economic turnaround have no parallel amongst our peers in developing countries globally,” said Prime Minister Holness. The Prime Minister noted that the 950-room expansion, valued at over 500 million euros, reflects the confidence of international investors in Jamaica’s economic stability and growth potential and extended his gratitude to Spain for its continued support of Jamaica’s tourism sector, citing Spain’s extensive investment in the country. The project will also include 600 houses for tourism workers. “I want to acknowledge and thank His Excellency the Ambassador from Spain for his country’s support for Jamaica’s tourism. You mentioned that you have a portfolio here of in excess of 2 billion euros invested right here. So, that’s a big vote that someone from another country would analyze our risk situation here and say I feel comfortable putting down that level of investment,” Dr. Holness remarked. Prime Minister Holness further noted that the consistent expansion of the sector demonstrates investor faith in Jamaica’s macroeconomic direction. “It’s clear businesses feel that the macroeconomic indicators are going in the right direction, which is why Minister Bartlett can say we have over 6,000 rooms that we will be breaking ground for or have already started this year – a massive vote of confidence in the government of Jamaica,” he added. While celebrating the growth of Jamaica’s tourism industry, Prime Minister Holness reaffirmed the government’s commitment to strengthening the linkages between tourism and other sectors, such as agriculture and manufacturing, thereby reducing import dependency. He outlined a clear directive for tourism investors to integrate local suppliers into their operations. “We must give our local producers who supply the tourism industry long-term supply contracts so that they can invest in building capacity and making the quality the standard that you would like. So that is a directive that if we don’t see it happen by virtue of this kind of moral suasion, then we will have to go further to ensure that as our tourism grows, it is genuinely growing sustainably and fairly, which for me, this means everybody will prosper,” he stressed. Minister of Tourism, Hon. Edmund Bartlett, echoed this sentiment, reaffirming that future tourism investments in Jamaica must include tangible benefits for local communities.” “Tourism is about people.” “This expansion is about people. Six hundred more houses for tourism workers, that is about people. We will have 950 of the finest rooms at a different level of experience with the elements of human capital development and growth embedded in it,” Minister Bartlett stated. The tourism minister also highlighted the significant opportunities that the project will bring for local businesses. “Nine hundred and fifty more rooms will provide countless new opportunities for linkages, and we have established that through policy and the activities of the Tourism Enhancement Fund to go at a dimension unprecedented in our history. From our discussions at FITUR, that was a critical part of the agreement; every investor that will come to Jamaica from henceforth must have a component for housing and linkages with the local economy,” he said. “We are grateful for the collaboration and commitment shown by our partners here in Hanover. In two years, I hope we will be enjoying these facilities not just as renderings but as a vibrant reality that sets new standards in hospitality,” added the President of the Palladium Hotel Group, Abel Matutes Prats. The expansion will include a state-of-the-art convention center capable of hosting over 1,000 guests, enhancing Jamaica’s position as a premier destination for conferences and events. Additionally, the project will introduce newly designed buildings focused on optimal energy efficiency and sustainability as well as the launch of educational initiatives and skill-development programs for residents.

The events welcomed a strong delegation of Turkish tour operators and 33 prominent media representatives, resulting in an overwhelming surge in media coverage. The widespread interest generated by these events has translated into over 100 media features across leading Turkish print and television outlets. This exceptional visibility has significantly enhanced Seychelles’ brand presence in Türkiye, increasing awareness and strengthening its appeal among both travelers and the travel trade. Further reinforcing this visibility, the Principal Secretary for Tourism, Mrs. Sherin Francis, who was present in Türkiye in January, actively engaged with key media houses, providing insightful interviews on Seychelles’ tourism offerings, sustainability initiatives, and future market strategies. Her participation played a vital role in amplifying Seychelles’ messaging, ensuring a compelling and authentic representation of the destination. Speaking about the events, Mrs. Sybille Cardon, representative of the Seychelles Hospitality & Tourism Association (SHTA) representative said; “I was pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome in Turkey and the strong turnout of agents and media who responded to our invitation. Our partners showed genuine interest in Seychelles, and our discussions were more than fruitful.” Mrs. Francis emphasized that while the Tourism Seychelles team and local partners worked diligently to ensure the success of these initiatives, the remarkable achievements would not have been possible without the unwavering support of Mr. Mehmet Selvi, Honorary Consul for Seychelles in Türkiye. His commitment and strategic efforts have been instrumental in strengthening Seychelles’ positioning within the Turkish market and fostering meaningful collaborations. Building on this momentum, Tourism Seychelles also conducted a series of targeted sales calls in early February to further engage trade partners. “It was a fantastic opportunity to showcase the destination and our diverse properties.” “I had the privilege of attending both the media and trade event, as well as the sales calls, where engaging discussions led to strong interest and tangible conversions for the destination. With partners eager to visit and gain firsthand experience to sell Seychelles better, this is undoubtedly a significant win for us,” said Mrs. Daphne Bonne from the Seychelles Small Hotels & Establishments Association (SSHEA). Additionally, Seychelles’ participation in the highly anticipated EMITT tourism event has further strengthened efforts to provide a dynamic platform for showcasing the destination. These continued efforts are expected to generate even greater media exposure, strengthen industry relationships, and ultimately drive more Turkish travelers to Seychelles’ shores.

This achievement confirmed the technical readiness and foundational principles of China’s self-developed AS700D, establishing a technical foundation for the future development of electric airships, according to AVIC. The maiden flight took place this morning in Jingmen, in central China’s Hubei Province. During the flight, the airship executed a vertical takeoff, swiftly ascended to an altitude of 50 meters, hovered briefly, and then performed a vertical landing, coming to a stable stop. The AS700D, developed by the Special Vehicle Research Institute under AVIC, is a novel all-electric airship that features a comprehensive electrification upgrade from the AS700 manned airship, which previously operated on aviation gasoline. Orders Pour in for China’s New AS700 Airship The AS700 was designed largely for civilian usage, specifically, in the tourism sector. The AS700D airship employs a sophisticated electric drive system powered by lithium batteries, along with an innovative propeller system, thrust-vector control mechanism, and an advanced cooling system, effectively replacing traditional aero-engines and fuel systems. According to Zhou Lei, the chief designer of the AS700D, “The airship’s utilization of lithium-battery power signifies a significant transformation, enabling it to achieve near-zero emissions and reduced noise levels during operation.” The AS700D is particularly well-suited for missions in environments with strict regulations regarding noise, emissions, and takeoff and landing protocols, such as nature reserves and ecologically sensitive regions, as well as for events like concerts and marathons, as noted by Zhou. With a maximum flight altitude of 3,100 meters and a top speed of 80 kilometers per hour, the AS700D can accommodate up to 10 individuals, including the pilot, as stated by its developers. This airship is capable of performing a variety of functions, including aerial photography, security surveillance, traffic management, and communication relay.

Reflecting on the founding of the GTRCMC and its expansion to include six satellites across the globe, he highlighted the role of Professor Lloyd Waller as executive director and other partners, noting that it was deliberately founded in academia “and not part of government and any political arrangement because one of the things I didn’t want is for any administration of the future, with a different philosophy and perspective, and even a different vision, to make any drastic changes to that construct which we established at the University of the West Indies.” Mr. Bartlett who founded the GTRCMC said: “Putting the Centre in the heart of academia ensured that it was insulated against political ambitions.” SEEN IN IMAGE: Jason Henzell (left), chairman of Jakes Hotel, Villas & Spa, the premier resort establishment in Treasure Beach, St. Elizabeth receives a Global Tourism Resilience award from Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Tourism, Jennifer Griffith during a special awards ceremony at the Princess Grand Jamaica resort on February 18, 2025.

Africa Tourism Surges with 74 Million Visitors in 2024,https://eturbonews.com/africa-tourism-surges-with-74-million-visitors-in-2024/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 20, 2025",N/A,Apolinari Tairo - eTN Tanzania,"Abundant in natural resources and rich in historical and cultural heritage, Africa has witnessed a notable increase in tourist arrivals from both international visitors and those traveling within the continent. According to a report by the United Nations Tourism (UNWTO), the continent welcomed approximately 74 million visitors last year, surpassing the figures from the previous year. Countries in North Africa experienced a significant rise in international arrivals compared to the last five years. This robust performance in tourism has established Africa as the second fastest-growing tourist destination globally, following the Middle East. Morocco and Egypt emerged as the primary tourist hotspots in Africa, while Kenya and Tanzania excelled in offering wildlife safari experiences. Additionally, destinations such as Cape Town in South Africa, Mauritius, Rwanda, and Botswana attracted a considerable number of tourists, particularly those seeking adventure. David Ryan, founder of Rhino Africa, expressed optimism regarding the continued rise in popularity of lesser-known destinations in Africa, including Rwanda, Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia, for the current year. Cultural, heritage, wildlife, and adventure tourism have drawn the majority of foreign visitors to Africa last year, aided by effective tourism campaigns, enhanced infrastructure, and a growing global interest in African travel experiences. International tourist arrivals are anticipated to increase by three to five percent this year, positioning Africa among the leading global tourist destinations. Economic uncertainties, geopolitical risks, and inflation have been identified as factors influencing travel patterns in Africa, necessitating prompt strategic investments in security, infrastructure, and travel marketing initiatives. The digital transformation across African nations has been recognized as essential for swift implementation to bolster competitiveness in the global tourism sector. Tanzania has entered 2024 with a modest increase in visitor numbers to its wildlife parks and other significant tourist attractions, with aspirations to draw five million tourists by 2025. Tanzania Targets More Tourists From Non-Traditional Markets Through diversification of tourist visiting sites and searching for new markets, Tanzania is targeting to intensify its tourism marketing in new tourist sources in South America, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa other than the traditional European and the United States markets. The Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB), in collaboration with private enterprises, is now focusing on promoting tourist attractions in the Southern Highlands, which are abundant in wildlife, cultural and historical significance, scenic beauty, and pristine beaches. Extensive promotional campaigns are currently in progress to stimulate tourism growth by highlighting new attractions in less developed regions of Tanzania. Efforts are underway to develop and diversify tourism for sustainable growth, particularly in promoting the southern tourist circuit, with the aim of increasing annual tourist arrivals in Tanzania. Visitors from Southern African countries, primarily South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, constitute the largest group of tourists traveling to Tanzania, predominantly via road transport, thereby facilitating the development of intra-African tourism. African Tourism Board – Tourism Organisation The African Tourism Board (ATB) is actively collaborating with African governments and key stakeholders in the tourism sector to position Africa as a unified destination, while advocating for regional and intra-African tourism initiatives aimed at both local and international travelers. The African Tourism Board (ATB) is currently engaged in promoting tourism development across the continent, with the goal of establishing Africa as a premier global tourist destination.

"US Travel Reforms Needed Before FIFA World Cup, Olympics Surge",https://eturbonews.com/us-travel-reforms-needed-before-fifa-world-cup-olympics-surge/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 19, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"America stands on the verge of a significant travel increase; however, without prompt intervention, our antiquated air travel infrastructure may struggle to cope with the impending demand, as highlighted in a recent report by the Commission on Seamless and Secure Travel. The Commission is comprised of former government officials — from the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Transportation Security Administration and the State Department — along with private sector experts from airport management and investment entities. Home | Homeland Security U.S. Department of Homeland Security: With honor and integrity, we will safeguard the American people, our homeland, and our values. The report outlines critical measures necessary to ensure that President Trump can usher in a “golden age of travel” in anticipation of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the 2025 Ryder Cup, and the celebration of America’s 250th anniversary. Today, the travel sector unveiled a strategic plan to establish America as the premier global travel destination while preventing significant entry delays, overwhelmed TSA checkpoints, and dissatisfied travelers as the nation gears up for a decade filled with historic international events. In addition to the security reforms detailed in the report, travel sector continues to advocate for the urgent modernization of air traffic control systems and solutions to address the shortage of air traffic controllers in the country. America is facing a remarkable opportunity — the critical question is whether we will take advantage of it or fall frustratingly short. The upcoming years will witness an unprecedented surge in travel demand that our current systems are ill-equipped to manage. Washington has a limited timeframe to address significant travel challenges and unlock a $100 billion economic potential — but this will necessitate a level of urgency that has been lacking in recent times. The recommendations put forth by the Commission were shaped by insights from experts in both government and the private sector, reflecting the diligent efforts and investments made by various agencies in the realm of national security, stated Kevin McAleenan, former Acting Secretary of Homeland Security and Chair of the Commission. He emphasized that the proposed measures aimed at bolstering security while improving facilitation through strategic technology investments, process enhancements, and collaboration between government and private entities present a significant opportunity to upgrade our travel infrastructure and attract more visitors. In light of the Commission’s findings, the US Travel urges Congress and the Trump Administration to implement four key actions: Establish leadership from the White House to represent America at major international events. The Trump Administration should promptly form a task force, led by a senior official from the White House, to ensure consistent leadership and attention throughout the federal government, capitalizing on global opportunities over the next four years. 2. Fulfill President Trump’s commitment to efficiently and securely process visas for the 2026 World Cup. Ensure robust consular staffing for visa processing. Extend the validity of B-1/B-2 visas for vetted, lawful visitors by an additional two years. Create a National Vetting Service that builds upon President Trump’s National Vetting Center, ensuring all visitor visas are processed within 30 days or less. Establish a “Secure Travel Partnership” initiative to expand the number of countries with strong travel security agreements with the United States, serving as a pathway to the Visa Waiver Program. 4. Develop the most advanced and secure airport screening procedures by making a significant investment in security technology. Immediately cease the diversion of the Passenger Security Fee and enhance funding for technology to guarantee that within five years, all travelers can carry larger liquids in their carry-ons, keep electronics and identification in their bags, and retain their shoes, jackets, and belts during screening. 80% of US Travelers Support TSA Biometrics Use Nine out of ten air travelers indicate that they would be more inclined or equally inclined to endorse the use of biometrics at TSA security checkpoints if it resulted in a reduction of the average time required to pass through security. 5. Construct robust, modern, and efficient airport borders to ensure the safety of America while facilitating global travel. Provide comprehensive staffing for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at airport customs. Eliminate lengthy customs wait times for Americans returning from abroad by utilizing biometrics and advanced vetting processes, allowing travelers to bypass meetings with a CBP officer unless they have items to declare. Enhance measures against immigration overstays by implementing biometric air exit procedures within two years. With support from both parties and a new administration established, the United States has a unique opportunity to revamp its travel infrastructure. This is the time to create the exceptional travel system that Americans rightfully deserve and that the global community anticipates.

February 19, 2025, will mark the inaugural Destination Professionals Day , honoring the people and organizations that drive tourism, economic growth and community vitality. The date holds special significance in the history of the destination organization sector. On February 19, 1896, members of the Detroit Chamber of Commerce and the Detroit Manufacturers Club came together at the Cadillac Hotel in Detroit, Michigan, to form the world’s first destination organization, the Detroit Convention and Businessman’s League. With a mission of “hustling for conventions,” this group laid the foundation for an industry that has since grown into a global driver of economic and social progress. “February 19, 1896, was a defining moment for the travel and tourism industry.” Don Welsh, President and CEO of Destinations International, added: “From that meeting in Detroit to today’s vast network of destination organizations, professionals have played a vital role in shaping thriving communities and economies around the world. Destination Professionals Day is our opportunity to celebrate their contributions and inspire future generations to join this exciting and impactful field.” “As the birthplace of the destination organization industry, Detroit is honored to be recognized on this momentous occasion,” said Claude Molinari, CDME, President and CEO of Visit Detroit. “The legacy of those early pioneers continues to inspire us as we champion our incredible region, and as other destination organizations worldwide promote their own communities as hubs of innovation, culture and economic opportunity.” From that first destination organization in 1896 to today, the industry has flourished. Now, there are more than 10,000 destination organizations around the world representing a broad spectrum of entities, including destination marketing organizations (DMOs), convention and visitors bureaus (CVBs), tourism boards, sports commissions and film offices. These organizations are a cornerstone of the travel and tourism industry, which employs almost 348 million people and was expected to contribute about 10% of global GDP – more than $11 trillion – to the global economy in 2024, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. Recognizing February 19 as Destination Professionals Day aims to raise awareness by highlighting the vital contributions of destination professionals in enriching community life and driving economic development; celebrate the achievements and recognize the hard work and dedication of destination professionals across all roles and organizations; and inspire future destination leaders by showcasing the diverse and rewarding career opportunities available in the sector to attract the next generation of professionals. Why February 19 Matters The selection of February 19 as Destination Professionals Day pays homage to the pioneering efforts of Detroit business leaders in 1896 and their vision of the potential for promoting their city as a destination for conventions and events. Their foresight and collaboration sparked a global movement that continues to transform destinations into ideal places to visit, live, work, play and invest.

Dallas Love Field Airport | Home US-based JetWind Power Corporation has successfully assembled and activated its pioneering Energy Capturing Pods at Texas air hub, launching a new phase in sustainable energy solutions for the airports all over the world. JetWind’s advanced technological innovation transforms the artificial wind generated by aircraft into electrical energy, subsequently utilized to power airport terminals. Energy Capturing Pods (ECPs) are cage-like structures housing turbines, designed to harness the jet stream. These installations are positioned behind aircraft on the tarmac. The electricity produced can be utilized for charging vehicles and mobile devices, generating sufficient power to supply an entire household on a daily basis. This project launched as a pilot program in 2021, featuring prototype Energy Capturing Pods positioned strategically in proximity to the control tower. The success of the pilot program prompted the airport to make a decision in December 2024 to expand the initiative, resulting in the acquisition of thirteen additional pods over the next three years. At present, the energy derived from jet exhaust is utilized to operate two new charging stations for travelers at the airport. Since the project’s launch, these charging stations have already successfully powered more than 10,000 personal devices. According to airport officials, new technology is also helping to reduce the strain on Texas’ power grid, producing sufficient energy to meet the annual needs of approximately 100 households. Love Field is the first air hub to implement new jet wind technology, but it is already attracting interest from the airports in Canada, Europe, Brazil, and Australia.

The launch event was attended by several members of the media, but the absence of the Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) has raised eyebrows. The SBC’s decision not to cover the event has sparked speculation and raised concerns about media independence, especially as St. Ange is now a political candidate in the upcoming elections. This has led to discussions around the right to free speech and the role of media in Seychelles’ political discourse. “My Journey – Life and Politics” is not only a personal memoir but a significant contribution to understanding the intricate political history of Seychelles, making it an essential read for anyone interested in the island nation’s past, present, and future.

Jamaica’s Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett’s who founded Tourism Resilience Day received a standing applause and presented his opening speech: Distinguished Guests, Esteemed Colleagues, Partners in Tourism, Ladies and Gentlemen: Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening—wherever you are joining us from around the world. It is my profound honor and privilege to stand before you today as both Minister of Tourism for the great nation of Jamaica and Chairman of the Global Tourism Resilience and Crisis Management Centre (GTRCMC). Global Tourism Resilience and Crisis Management Centre – GTRCMC – Global Tourism Resilience and Crisis Management Centre – GTRCMC The global tourism industry, especially those segments focused on coastal and marine environments has faced significant disruptions from external shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic. We gather here at the dawn of an era that demands new vision, renewed commitment, and unwavering resolve. We come together on this 3rd Global Tourism Resilience Conference to celebrate our shared achievements, confront our common vulnerabilities, and chart a course forward for tourism worldwide. Today’s conference is doubly significant as we also observe Global Tourism Day, a day dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of building resilience across our sector and creating spaces for dialogue and transformative actions. Decoding the Future of Tourism Resilience at UN Tourism Bartlett Style The United Nations has played an important role in tourism resilience. The person behind the UN tourism resilience movement in the Jamaica Minister of Tourism, Hon. Edmund Bartlett, who officially presented to UN Tourism Executive Council members how to decode the future of tourism resilience. The Importance of Tourism to World Development Tourism is not merely about leisure or sightseeing; it is the lifeblood of many economies, a catalyst for world development, and a critical pillar in the architecture of global growth. For developing countries, in particular, tourism represents a path to empowerment, job creation, poverty alleviation, and the preservation of cultural heritage. It fosters cross-cultural exchange, promotes tolerance, and deepens our shared sense of humanity. Yet, the benefits of tourism are not exclusive to developing nations alone. Tourism is a worldwide economic driver—employing one in every ten individuals globally. It is a unifying thread that weaves together people from different walks of life, bridging continents and cultures, and serving as an engine of prosperity. UN makes Global Tourism Resilience Day official Today is a giant day for the United Nations, World Tourism, and Jamaica. The Hon. Minister Bartlett did it! The UN makes Global Tourism Resilience Day official. The Impact of COVID-19 and the Imperative of Resilience When the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, few industries felt its fury more intensely than the tourism sector. In a matter of weeks, borders were sealed, flights were grounded, and the flow of travelers ceased almost entirely. This abrupt halt was not merely a momentary inconvenience; it was an economic earthquake that shook communities and livelihoods worldwide. But tourism, by its very nature, is resilient. It thrives on human curiosity, our innate desire to explore the unknown, and our deep longing to connect with the global community. Indeed, we have seen that tourism can spring back with remarkable vigor. Yet, even as it recovers, we must not ignore its vulnerabilities. From natural disasters to geopolitical shocks, from health emergencies to climate change—these challenges stand ever-present, testing the durability of our beloved industry. That is why our collective mission must be to mitigate these vulnerabilities and strengthen the resilience of tourism. We must harness innovation, champion sustainability, and foster collaboration across all sectors to ensure that the next crisis—whatever form it takes—does not cripple our progress but rather spurs our creativity and resolve. The Role of GTRCMC and the Government of Jamaica Here, allow me to underscore the role of the Global Tourism Resilience and Crisis Management Centre, headquartered in Jamaica. Established on the principle that knowledge is our most powerful weapon against uncertainty, the GTRCMC has been a leader and advocate for building resilience across the global tourism ecosystem. As Chairman, I have had the honor of witnessing firsthand the Centre’s dedication to research, training, advocacy, and strategic partnerships. Alongside the Government of Jamaica—an unwavering proponent of tourism resilience—we have rallied global stakeholders and policymakers to adopt preventive measures, bolster crisis response, and advance a more sustainable tourism model. Embracing Digital Technologies for a More Resilient Tourism Sector In our quest to build resilience, digital technology is a formidable ally. From artificial intelligence to data analytics, from virtual reality experiences to blockchain-based transparency, the digital realm offers us an extraordinary toolkit to anticipate challenges and innovate solutions. These technologies enable: Real-Time Data and Analytics – Monitoring travel flows, consumer trends, and potential risks, allowing us to make proactive decisions. Virtual Engagements and Marketing – Offering immersive experiences that can keep destinations top-of-mind even during travel pauses. Smart Destination Management – Enhancing visitor experiences through digital ticketing, crowd management, and personalized itineraries that promote sustainability and authenticity. Robust Crisis Communication – Facilitating swift and clear communication with stakeholders, travelers, and local communities in times of crisis. By weaving these digital tools into our tourism strategies, we can foresee disruptions, respond effectively to crises, and ensure the continuity of this vital sector. GTRCMC’s Work in Building Resilience At the GTRCMC, we focus on a range of thematic areas that advance tourism resilience worldwide. We have led innovative programs and strategic alliances that speak to our commitment: Climate Tourism Resilience o In partnership with JICA (the Japan International Cooperation Agency) and Airbnb, we have launched initiatives here in the Caribbean to support small tourism enterprises and coastal communities, ensuring they are more robust in the face of climate-related threats. Pandemic Management o Through collaboration with CARPHA (the Caribbean Public Health Agency), we developed guidelines and frameworks to prepare destinations for health emergencies, enabling them to weather the storm of COVID-19 and any future pandemics more effectively. Entrepreneurial Resilience in Jordan o Through cultural heritage projects, we have empowered local entrepreneurs to protect, preserve, and promote Jordan’s rich historical sites, ensuring that tourism growth aligns with heritage conservation. Digital Resilience: AI Initiatives o Now, we are pleased to announce a new frontier of work focused on digital resilience. The GTRCMC will be rolling out a series of AI-driven initiatives designed to enhance destinations worldwide—from dedicated training and capacity-building programs to thought leadership and advocacy efforts. By equipping tourism stakeholders with cutting-edge digital skills, we aim to reshape the industry, making it more agile, inclusive, and future-ready. These initiatives, collectively, stand to transform global tourism. They illustrate how resilience-building efforts can range from environmental sustainability to public health, from heritage preservation to digital innovation—all converging to create a seamless and sustainable global tourism environment. The Purpose of Global Tourism Day Ladies and Gentlemen, that is precisely why Global Tourism Day stands as a beacon of unity and inspiration. It reminds us that tourism is not an isolated activity, but a grand tapestry of interconnected aspirations, livelihoods, and cultural dialogues. • We observe this day to raise consciousness about the magnitude of building resilience. • We dedicate this day to fostering open dialogue, knowledge-sharing, and innovative collaborations—like the conference we are opening today. • We take this day to reaffirm our collective commitment to fortifying the tourism sector against ever-evolving global threats and uncertainties. So as we observe Global Tourism Day today, let us recognize the unparalleled potential of digital technologies to revolutionize tourism, making it more resilient, inclusive, and dynamic for generations to come. Opening the Conference & Observing the Day In this spirit of optimism and determination, I now declare the 3rd Global Tourism Resilience Conference officially open. Let these next few days be filled with robust discussions, groundbreaking ideas, and concrete action plans. May we leave this summit with renewed purpose, armed with fresh insights to propel our industry forward. As we celebrate Global Tourism Day, let us recommit ourselves to the noble endeavor of harnessing tourism’s power for the advancement of humanity. Let us strengthen the very foundations that make our sector vibrant, sustainable, and unwavering in the face of adversity. A Final Spark of Inspiration In closing, I invite each of you to remain for the spectacular light show that will take place shortly—a radiant symbol of our collective brilliance and the enlightenment that emerges when we unite in purpose. May its luminous display serve as a powerful reminder that in the darkest of times, human creativity and collaboration can shine the brightest. Thank you for your unwavering support, for your dedication to the cause of tourism resilience, and for standing beside us as we forge a brighter, more sustainable future. Let the conference begin, and may our work here light a path to a new era of global tourism resilience. Thank you, and may blessings abound for you, your organizations, and the communities you serve.

Stansted Airport: The Rise and the New Plans,https://eturbonews.com/stansted-airport-the-rise-and-the-new-plans/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 17, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"In the year 1942, during a time of conflict, the United States Army Air Forces constructed a runway on the verdant fields of Essex, in proximity to the village of Stansted Mountfitchett. The etymology of ‘Stansted’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon term meaning ‘stony place,’ a designation potentially unsuited for aviation operations. Nonetheless, the runway was established, marking the commencement of the airfield’s contribution to the Allied war effort. Stansted served as a base for heavy bombers and functioned as a maintenance and supply depot responsible for the overhaul and modification of Martin B-26 Marauder twin-engine bombers. Notably, on D-Day in 1944, aircraft stationed at Stansted played a pivotal role in a contingent of 600 planes overseeing the beaches of occupied France. Official website for London Stansted Airport Official website for London Stansted Airport, live flight information, car parking & booking flights. In 1966, following the establishment of the British Airports Authority, the agency assumed control of Stansted. It quickly became evident that the airport was poised to emerge as a significant entity within British aviation. A terminal extension was necessitated a mere four years later, and shortly thereafter, in 1974, the government proposed a substantial expansion initiative aimed at accommodating an initial capacity of 8 million passengers, later adjusted to 15 million per annum. Since that time, Stansted’s capacity has witnessed a continual upward trajectory. By 2002, planning permission was secured to expand the airport’s capabilities to serve 25 million passengers annually, and by August 2007, 2.5 million travelers had passed through its gates in a single month. Additionally, by 2010, authorization was granted for Stansted to accommodate Code F aircraft, including the large Airbus A-380 and Boeing 747-8. UK’s most punctual airports Industry experts have revealed which of the UK’s airports were the most punctual and reliable during June after analyzing the Civil Aviation Authority’s (CAA) In October 2024, a significant enhancement plan valued at £1.1 billion was announced by the Manchester Airports Group, to be executed over a period of five years. This upgrade will entail a £600 million extension to the passenger terminal, which will incorporate additional seating areas, as well as a greater selection of shops, restaurants, and bars. Opting to extend the existing terminal rather than constructing a new one enables Stansted to maintain its status as a single-terminal airport, a feature deemed advantageous for the simplicity of passenger travel. Furthermore, the security hall is slated for expansion, including the addition of extra check-in desks and new baggage reclaim carousels, alongside upgrades to the airfield taxiway. With a focus on sustainability, a new 14.3-megawatt solar farm will be constructed on-site to address Stansted’s growing electricity requirements. The airport currently operates a biomass boiler and has achieved the Carbon Trust Standard, alongside recognition of Level 3+ carbon neutral status from Airports Council International. Upon the completion of the development, the annual passenger capacity at Stansted Airport is projected to reach 43 million. This forecast positions Stansted to surpass Gatwick’s 41 million, thereby establishing itself as the United Kingdom’s second busiest airport, following Heathrow. This anticipated growth is not unexpected; Stansted has consistently set new passenger number records each month in 2024. Notably, on Friday, August 23rd, over 103,000 passengers traveled through Stansted—a record for that month—significantly influenced by a surge in attendees returning from Taylor Swift’s concerts held at the nearby Wembley Stadium earlier that week. The government forecasts that the forthcoming expansion will double the airport’s annual economic contribution to the UK economy, elevating it to £2 billion. Additionally, this initiative is projected to create approximately 5,000 new jobs resulting from the investment. In March 2024, British Airways resumed operations at Stansted for the first time since the onset of the Covid pandemic, with routes to Florence, Ibiza, and Nice. However, the airport offers far greater options, servicing a total of 200 alternative destinations for its passengers. New airlines joining Stansted’s roster in 2024 include the Turkish-German carrier Sun Express and Royal Jordanian Airlines. From its inception as a greenfield runway in 1942 to its current stature as a vital component of the UK aviation sector, Stansted has undergone significant transformation over the past 82 years. Aviation enthusiasts are poised to observe developments with keen interest as the latest expansion unfolds.

Are Global Travel & Tourism Leaders Inspiring Hope?,https://eturbonews.com/are-global-travel-tourism-leaders-inspiring-hope/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 15, 2025",N/A,Imtiaz Muqbil,"A report by the Gallup Organization regarding the future of global leadership indicates that the foremost quality followers desire in their leaders, particularly among the youth, is the ability to inspire hope. Following this, the traits of trust, compassion, and stability are also highly valued. As I examined the findings of this report, I found myself pondering whether leaders in the Travel & Tourism sector have adequately addressed these essential needs. With a few notable exceptions, I remain uncertain. World Government Summit | World Governments Summit 2025 Shaping Future Governments This report, prepared for the World Governments Summit in Dubai from February 11 to 14, serves as a significant revelation for leaders across various domains—national, corporate, institutional, societal, and more. Despite the prevailing narrative of profound transformation in our times, the report asserts that the four key characteristics sought by followers in their leaders have remained consistent. The prominence of HOPE is evident throughout the document. In what can be considered its most significant statement, the report articulates the concept of “HOPE” as follows: “Above all, HOPE represents the conviction that the future holds greater promise than the present, and that individuals possess the agency to effectuate this change. If a leader fails to instill a sense of HOPE and guide others toward a clearer path, it is unlikely that anyone else will succeed in doing so.” In a striking departure from traditional perspectives, the report poses the question, “What constitutes an effective leader? Is it courage, empathy, creativity, or the ability to inspire? The complexities of leadership are manifold, yet the essence of effective leadership lies in addressing the needs of those they lead.” In essence, leadership transcends the pursuit of increased profit margins, the enhancement of products, the maximization of shareholder value, or the expansion of membership. These aspects are secondary. The primary focus must be on fostering hope and fulfilling that promise. Upon reviewing the report, I assessed its conclusions using the following checklist questions: Are any global leaders effectively inspiring and fostering hope? The Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization? The chairman of the Pacific Asia Travel Association? The CEO of the World Travel & Tourism Council? Readers are encouraged to conduct their own assessments in corporate boardrooms, academic settings, and management discussions. The report should motivate leaders in Travel & Tourism to reconsider their fundamental purpose and reflect on how they can instill hope, cultivate trust, demonstrate compassion, and enhance stability—not only within their immediate domains but also in broader contexts. Additionally, it should prompt them to explore strategies for transforming what seems to be a HOPELESS global situation into a HOPEFUL one. The images below, which specifically reference HOPE, are self-explanatory. I urge readers to download the accessible report. In my opinion, it will eliminate the necessity for further lectures on leadership from highly compensated management experts.

Cheap Flights in Europe on Ryanair are Ending,https://eturbonews.com/cheap-flights-in-europe-on-ryanair-are-ending/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 14, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Irish ultra low-cost carrier Ryanair has announced substantial reductions in its European flight operations and discontinuation of certain routes to key destinations in 2025, due to escalating airport fees, increased government taxes and surcharges it would need to pay. The low-cost carrier has revealed plans to close multiple bases and reduce flight frequencies to Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. According to the carrier, these adjustments arise from surging operational expenses that hinder Ryanair’s ability to sustain its low fare offerings. As a result, Ryandair customers may encounter a decrease in available flight options this year and possible increase in airfares in the near future. Ryanair Threatens Closure of Bordeaux Base Over Fee Dispute | eTN | 2024 In a bold move, Ryanair issued a stark warning on Wednesday, hinting at the potential closure of its base in Bordeaux if the airport in southwestern France proceeds with fee hikes. Earlier this month, Ryanair also announced its intention to eliminate paper boarding passes, opting for digital check-in procedures instead, triggering heavy criticism from the customers. The impending changes restricting affordable alternatives will most likely affect millions of air travelers, though it is not clear whether these schedule cuts and fare increases will be permanent or if they are part of the carrier’s broader negotiation strategy.

Fully allocated seating and much more now available online. Last month, Ryanair announced its decision to withdraw one of its aircraft stationed in Rome at Fiumicino Airport, the largest in Italy, for the summer of 2025. The airline indicated that this action would result in no expansion for Rome, despite the ongoing Jubilee celebrations. The airline attributed this development to municipal surcharges imposed at major Italian airports, effective April 1, 2025. Ryanair has also discontinued all flights to and from Aalborg, Denmark following the introduction of new Danish aviation taxes. The new tax, set at 50DKK ($7.04), will be applicable to all passengers departing from Denmark and will be absorbed by airlines. Consequently, starting next month, all flights from London Stansted to Aalborg will be canceled. However, other airlines, including KLM, Norwegian Air, and Scandinavian Airlines, will continue to operate flights from the UK to Aalborg, although passengers will need to take connecting flights to reach their destination. In Austria, Ryanair criticized new steep €12 ($12.60) air traffic tax, along with the country’s significantly high airport and security fees, stating that it undermines Austria’s appeal as a tourist destination in comparison to lower-cost EU nations such as Sweden, Hungary, and certain regions of Italy, all of which are eliminating aviation taxes and lowering access costs to foster traffic and tourism growth. In Spain, Irish budget carrier has announced that it is slashing its Spanish summer 2025 traffic by 18% with the loss of -800,000 seats, and 12 routes. Accoring to airline, it would close its Jerez and Valladolid operations, remove one based aircraft from Santiago, and will cut traffic at five other regional airports – Vigo (-61%), Santiago (-28%), Zaragoza (-20%), Asturias (-11%) and Santander (-5%) in summer of 2025. France’s aviation tax is projected to more than double by 2025, a move that appears to have garnered support from Minister of Public Accounts Amélie de Montchalin. She stated, “This initiative reflects a commitment to fiscal and ecological equity,” noting that the wealthiest 20 percent of the population accounts for over half of air travel expenditures. This development may prompt Ryanair to scale back its routes within the country. Asccording to some reports, the airline has already shuttered its Bordeaux base last year and has withdrawn from operating flights to Paris.

He saw the new flight arrangements as Jamaica being able “to future proof the market at a level never seen before” in terms of “marketing engagement and airlift arrangements that we are now experiencing.

Mr. Ncube delivered an inspiring keynote address at the opening ceremony of the Malawi Tourism and Hospitality Capacity Building Training, which is taking place at Umodzi Park in Lilongwe, the capital city of Malawi. He praised the Malawi Tourism Council for its forward-thinking leadership in orchestrating this initiative in partnership with the ATB and the African Union. He highlighted that the training serves as a catalyst for promoting self-empowerment within the tourism industry, providing stakeholders with crucial resources for sustainable development. African Tourism Board – Tourism Organisation The Executive Chairman of the ATB fervently supported the notion of self-identity as a key element in bolstering Malawi’s global standing, leveraging its rich cultural heritage and distinctive tourism offerings. According to Mr. Ncube, Malawi has the opportunity to strategically establish itself as a leader in Africa’s sustainable tourism sector. His address has laid the groundwork for an event focused on fostering collaboration, empowerment, and realizing Malawi’s full potential in the international tourism landscape. “Our initiative is not just about skill enhancement, it’s about transforming potential into tangible profits for communities,” the ATB representative said. “By promoting sustainable tourism practices, we not only uplift local economies but also ensure that visitors develop a deeper appreciation for the cultures and environments they encounter,” the ATB representative added during the training session. Malawi’s Minister of Tourism, Vera Kamtukule, emphasized the critical need for authentic representation to elevate Malawi’s presence on the global stage. She urged stakeholders in the industry to craft a narrative that showcases the country’s dynamic identity, ensuring that Malawi not only stands out within Africa’s tourism landscape but also secures recognition internationally. In her opening remarks to officials and delegates participating in the capacity-building training, the minister highlighted the significance of Malawi’s rich culture, heritage, and untapped tourism potential. The Capacity Building Training for Malawi’s tourism sector represents a crucial advancement in positioning this African nation as a leading destination, merging tradition with innovation to foster sustainable growth in the tourism industry, she stated. Additionally, she underscored the importance of collaboration among local communities, businesses, and governmental bodies to develop a tourism experience that is both distinctive and sustainable. By capitalizing on its diverse landscapes, wildlife, and cultural festivals, Malawi can provide visitors with an unforgettable experience that respects and preserves its natural and cultural assets, according to the minister. She also noted the vital role of technology in modernizing the tourism sector and encouraged stakeholders to utilize digital platforms to reach a wider audience and offer personalized experiences that align with the changing expectations of travelers. This strategy has the potential to attract a new generation of tourists in search of authenticity and adventure. Additionally, education and training have been acknowledged as vital elements in this transformative process. By providing the workforce with necessary skills and knowledge, Malawi can guarantee superior service and hospitality, thus improving the overall experience for visitors. A noticeable atmosphere of optimism and dedication permeated the gathering of training participants, who conveyed their resolve to collaborate in advancing Malawi’s tourism sector. The Malawi Tourism and Hospitality Capacity Building Training took place from February 10th to 12th, with participants hailing from Malawi and its neighboring countries in Southern and Eastern Africa.

Is Some Alcohol Acceptable for Airline Pilots to Fly?,https://eturbonews.com/is-some-alcohol-acceptable-for-airline-pilots-to-fly/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 11, 2025",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"Initially, the 2 pilots lied about their alcohol consumption. Both had taken their own breath tests while still at the hotel the morning of the flight, which revealed they exceeded JAL’s standards on levels acceptable to fly. The Captain called in claiming to be ill and requested a shift delay while the co-pilot proceeded to the airport anyway. From the time he had taken his own breath test at the hotel at around 5 am, the airline took several tests over the next 3 hours until his alcohol blood level was in the “safe” zone. By then, the Captain had arrived at the airport at 6 am and cleared the limit for being authorized to fly. JAL Flight 744 eventually departed Melbourne 3 hours and 11 minutes late due to the incident. Even small amounts of alcohol can be critical when it comes to cognitive skills, especially critical for pilots who are responsible for the safe transport of human lives. Alcohol has been proven to affect reaction time, judgment, and decision making. The captain had 15,632 flight hours under his belt and was suspended for 180 days while the co-pilot has been suspended for 210 days from flying with 13,310 flight hours to his name. There were 103 passengers and 11 crew members, which included 2 captains, one co-pilot, and 8 cabin attendants onboard the Boeing 787-8 flight. How Much is Too Much? The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates a minimum of 8 hours between consuming alcohol and operating an aircraft, with many airlines requiring 12 to 24 hours prior to flying. This is commonly referred to as the “bottle to throttle” rule. As far as the actual alcohol limits goes, the FAA enforces a 0.04% blood alcohol limit for pilots (the limit for driving is less strict at 0.08%). Other aviation authorities, such as EASA in Europe and ICAO on a global level, have similar limits. Is it the high stress nature of the job itself? Is it the long hours or the erratic schedules? Is it the boredom between take-off and landing? Or could it be the time spent away from family? Whatever “it” is, alcohol consumption is a serious issue in the airline industry. When it comes to who is flying the plane, this critical responsibility for usually hundreds of passengers is especially cause for concern if not downright alarm. If the FAA can have a zero-tolerance mandate for unruly airline passengers, why can it not have a zero-tolerance policy for the very people entrusted to safely navigate the aircraft transporting those people? FAA: Zero-Tolerance Policy Against Unruly Passengers Here to Stay The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will make its Zero Tolerance policy against unruly passengers permanent. “Behaving dangerously on a plane will cost you; that’s a promise,” said Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen. “Unsafe behavior simply does not fly and keeping our Zero Tolerance policy will help us continue making progress to prevent and punish this behavior.” Is Every Pilot Tested Prior to Flights? In a word, no. Airlines do conduct random testing for alcohol and drugs on pilots, however, the very nature of random testing relies on the pilots themselves governing themselves to assure they are in the proper state to fly. If a pilot tests over the limit, consequences may include being removed from duty immediately, suspension or revocation of their pilot’s license, permanent termination by the airline, and in some cases, fines may be imposed or even criminal charges. Before being allowed to reapply for a license, pilots must complete mandatory rehabilitation programs. In the US, HIMS (Human Intervention Motivation Study) help pilots with seeking treatment. Rehabilitation programs involve psychological and medical evaluation, detox treatment and rehabilitation, employer and peer support, and monitoring and testing, as well as the process to get re-certified. High Profile Cases There have been more than one would probably care to know about high-profile cases of pilots caught under the influence of alcohol, which have led to terminations, arrests, and even changes in airline policies. Here are some of the more prominent cases. American Airlines Pilot Arrested An American Airlines pilot was removed from the cockpit at Edinburgh Airport in Scotland after failing a pre-flight alcohol test in June 2023. The pilot was subsequently arrested and the flight scheduled to depart for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was cancelled. Air India Pilot Suspended for Failing Alcohol Test AFTER Flight An Air India pilot violated India aviation authority Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) rules by failing a post-flight alcohol test. This was the pilot’s second offense, resulting in his license being suspended for 3 years. Delta Airlines Pilot Arrested Before Flight A Delta Airlines pilot was arrested at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in 2018 for a flight that was headed to San Diego, California, after failing a TSA screening in which an open container of alcohol was found. The pilot was immediately removed from flying and subsequently arrested and charged. Delta Airlines has a zero-tolerance policy on alcohol. Japan Airlines Pilots 10 Times Over Legal LImit A Japan Airlines co-pilot, Katsutoshi Jitsukawa, was caught at Heathrow Airport in London in 2018 for a flight scheduled for Tokyo, Japan, with a blood alcohol level shockingly 10 times over the legal limit. The pilot was sentenced to 10 months in prison in the UK. This incident also led to Japan Airlines beefing up its alcohol testing protocols. Lion Air Pilot Slurring on Radio An Indonesian Lion Air pilot was caught slurring his speech during pre-flight radio communications in 2017 on a route scheduled to fly another domestic route in Indonesia. He was removed from the flight and after testing positive for alcohol was fired from his job. United Airlines Pilot Pulled from Cockpit for Intoxication A United Airlines pilot was removed from the cockpit before takeoff for a flight scheduled to depart Austin, Texas, after it was determined that he was intoxicated. The outcome is that the pilot was arrested. In a Business Where Human Lives are at Stake Preventative measures certainly are markers for safety when it comes to putting our lives in the hands of those who provide transportation services, whether on the road in a vehicle, at sea aboard ship, on the rails of a train, or in the skies with hundreds of other passengers. In a world where so many circumstances are out of our control, when something as simple as a test can determine the safety of lives, there should be 100% action taken versus random testing. I’d wait a few extra minutes for that to happen, wouldn’t you? Is a Career as a Pilot Right for You? Becoming a pilot is a dream job-or isn’t it? Developments in financial support, inclusion, and technologies mean pilot training is becoming more diversified and accessible.

The project will see several street view-equipped vehicles with mounted camera systems roaming roadways throughout the islands to capture more than 2,000,000 geolocated 360-degree images for showcasing the country on Google Maps. “We are excited to collaborate with World Travel in 360 and smooth a path for Google Street View to immortalize our islands with 360-degree imagery on Google Maps,” said the Hon. I. Chester Cooper, Bahamas Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, Investments & Aviation. “Access and engagement are bedrock principles of tourism success. This project will make it easy for travelers from around the world to size up the beauty and wonders of The Bahamas from wherever they are.” The Bahamas Street View Coverage for Google Maps is proposed to capture imagery of more than 3,729 miles (6,000 kilometers) of key tourist areas throughout the country’s more than 700 islands, including 16 major islands whose towns, beaches and other attractions are visited by millions of in-coming travelers. With the imagery capture, The Bahamas will join more than 100 countries and territories currently featured, in whole or in part, on the Street View function of Google Maps, which enables users to explore settings around the world via 360-degree images. The function is among the most popular features of applications on Google Maps, enabling users to effortlessly plan visits, observe attractions, pinpoint restaurants and hotels, and more using the convenience of technologies including mobile devices, tablets, and computers. Among a host of popular tourist areas proposed to be photographed through the Street View Project are Downtown Nassau and Montagu Beach in Nassau; Port Lucaya Marketplace and Peterson Cay National Park in Grand Bahama; and Marsh Harbour, Green Turtle Cay and Cherokee Sound in The Abacos. Street View is not for vacation planning alone, but benefits of imagery captured ranges from support for urban planning and emergency response, to historical preservation and environmental conservation. Special considerations are also being made to increase public awareness of the Street View Project locally in The Bahamas, as well as for the mapping of sensitive areas and special restrictions and permission for capturing images in public areas. “In today’s digital landscape, immersive experiences are key to attracting travelers.” Latia Duncombe, Director General, the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, Investments & Aviation, added: “This Google Street View initiative is a game-changer for Bahamian tourism. By bringing our islands to life on Google Maps, we’re not just showcasing our beauty, we’re making The Bahamas more accessible than ever before. “Potential visitors can explore our diverse offerings virtually in the palm of their hands, igniting their desire to visit and experience the authentic wonder of our islands firsthand. This initiative also presents a tremendous opportunity for local businesses—restaurants, hotels, and attractions—by increasing their visibility to a global audience and making it easier for travelers to discover and support them before they even arrive.” For more information on recent BMOTIA tourism efforts, please visit their website.

Google Maps Will No Longer Help You Plan Your Gulf of Mexico Trip,https://eturbonews.com/google-maps-will-no-longer-help-you-plan-your-gulf-of-mexico-trip/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 11, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"On his first day in office, January 20, US President Trump demanded the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico into Gulf of America, due to its “importance to the nation.” In addition, Trump ordered the renaming of the highest peak in North America from Denali to its previous name, Mount McKinley, a tribute to the 25th US president, William McKinley. Google has previously stated that it adheres to a “longstanding practice” of implementing name changes on its Google Maps when they are reflected in official government documentation. Google Maps Find local businesses, view maps and get driving directions in Google Maps. Yesterday, in accordance with Trump’s executive order which aims to commemorate “American Greatness,” Google Maps has officially renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the ‘Gulf of America’ for users located in the United States. In a social media post, the technology company confirmed that it would update Google Maps to align with the recent change made by the US Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), which officially changed ‘Gulf of Mexico’ to ‘Gulf of America.’ Google Maps users in the United States will now see the ‘Gulf of America’, whereas in Mexico, Google will maintain the designation ‘Gulf of Mexico’. Customers in the countries other than Mexico and the United States will see both names displayed as ‘Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)’. According to Google, the naming convention is determined by the user’s location settings. The gulf, which connects to the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, extends along the eastern coastline of Mexico, the southeastern coastline of the United States, and the western perimeter of Cuba. The designation Gulf of Mexico has been utilized by European explorers and cartographers for more than 400 years. Google’s take on the renaming of the gulf bears strong resemblance to other contentious or variably designated geographic features, such as the maritime area situated between Japan and Korea, which is referred to as the ‘Sea of Japan (East Sea)’ in certain international discussions. US President Trump makes Canadians Vacation in Mexico – No Tariff Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, is asking fellow Canadians to avoid vacationing in the United States. Others say Mexico is warm and beautiful and a to-go destination for Canadian holiday seekers. This anti-tourism verbiage responded to a 25% tariff forced upon Canada by US President Donald Trump. Trump’s initiative to rename the gulf has encountered significant resistance abroad. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has asserted that both Mexico and the international community will continue to refer to the water body as the Gulf of Mexico, emphasizing that the United States “cannot unilaterally alter the designation of an international waterway” that has been acknowledged “for centuries.” The United Kingdom and Canada have also announced that they will continue the use of the original name.

Marketing in Good and Challenging Times,https://eturbonews.com/marketing-in-good-and-challenging-times/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 7, 2025",N/A,Dr. Peter E. Tarlow,"Furthermore, tourism is influenced by many factors outside of the industry’s control. Travelers may change plans or destinations, or even cancel trips, due to economic, health, political or social factors. Tourism marketers must often try to convince an ever more skeptical public that vacations are more than mere superficial wants; and that they serve a real and needed purpose. Over the last decade tourism marketers have struggled with the question such as if a vacation is a want or a need. They also struggled with defining what tourism marketing is. For example, in 2013 The Board of Directors of the American Marketing Association approved the following: Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large. (Approved July 2013). The definition created new challenges. For example, how are tourism marketers to define value? Tourism marketers must not only prove to their potential clients that their product has value, but in a composite industry, such as tourism, there is no one single product. The tourism experience begins even before the moment the client (tourist, visitor) leaves home and continues until past the time that the client has returned home. Along the way, the tourism marketer must deal with a variety of products and services that range from the air/bus/train terminal experience to the actual transportation experience or in the case of a private vehicle, the roadway experience. There is also the dining experience, the lodging experience, and the quality of the visitors’ activities. To make matters even more complicated tourism customers are young and old, speak different languages and come with a wide range of expectations, wants and criteria. Marketing is never easy and requires both basic and sophisticated strategies . To help you develop some of these strategies Tourism Tidbits offers the following advice. Develop a realistic budget and learn to live within the budget One of the great mistakes in marketing is spending more than you take in. Be frugal, but not stingy, in how you spend your marketing money. Ask yourself what is a realistic expected rate of return on the money that you spend and are your marketing techniques appropriate for the targeted social group? Know with which demographic groups you are most likely to succeed Different groups of visitors want different experiences and different takeaways. It is essential that your marketing matches your demographics. Older visitors want a very different experience than younger visitors. Demographics should be broken down by age, gender and in today’s word gender-orientation, cultural desires and needs, distance to be traveled, and economic groups. No tourism destination can be all things to all people. Success is defined by matching your tourism offering to the correct demographic group. Know what you are marketing It is amazing how many organizations are confused as to what their base business is. For example, is an airline marketing transportation, travel, or a destination? In in the leisure tourism industry, we often state that we are marketing relaxation, but in reality what we are really marketing Is post vacation memories. That means that marketing must include not only what the visitor receives during the experience but also what the visitor takes away from the experience. Do not depend on any one form of marketing Different demographic groups require different marketing strategies. For example, younger generations are likely to respond differently to high tech or certain types of social media than older generations. Social media is a great tool for some but not all demographic groups. Furthermore, social media have many forms and these forms experience their own market lifecycle. For example, some forms of social media that were in vogue with the under 25 crowd only a few years ago, are now barely considered relevant by members of that generation today. Using social media as a media tool means being on top of the current trends and knowing which group not only reads social media, but also perhaps more importantly permits social media to influence its decision-making and believes social media. Do not forget about the value of word-of-mouth Wordof-mouth is an effective tool especially when one is marketing to a more educated and upscale market. Although it is slower in reaching vast quantities of potential clients, as a tool it can be highly effective. Word-of-mouth marketing is not simply a haphazard phenomenon. In fact, it is estimated that many products and services are purchased because someone has told them about a particular brand. The best word-of-mouth advertising is based on a clear plan. Here are some word-of-mouth tips to consider and remember word-of-mouth requires out of the box thinking and lots of creativity: 1. It is free and therefore we can see word-of-mouth marketing as a great leveler. This is especially true for small businesses that do not have a large advertising budget. 2. To get your narrative into the public realm make sure that you live your story. For example, if one of the things that you want people to talk about is your excellent customer service, then be sure to provide that level of service. The marketing goal is to transform your service or product into a brand or narrative and then by your actions have it become the narrative. 3. Think customer loyalty! Give your customers the sense that they are part of you; that the narrative belongs as much to them as it does to you. You can accomplish this goal by giving people the sense that they are “insiders” and part of your business family. To do this you have to do more than merely survey your customers. Make sure that you take their opinions seriously. If customers want to see a particular change, then try and implement that change as soon as possible. 4. Meet with some of your customers. Invite them to face-to-face conversations with your senior management; let them know that they are on the same team as you. 5. Listen more and talk less. The more you listen the more others will talk about you. Getting customer feedback in an unobtrusive and polite way shows that you care and the hospitality industry is nothing without caring. Compete against yourself and not against your colleagues Good marketing is not negative marketing. Using negative marketing may work in political campaigns, but rarely if ever works in tourism. The best marketing is when you are able to demonstrate to the public that your great offering has now become even better. That means you have to know what your offerings are and what “better” means to your public. You have to be open to get business Many stores especially in smaller communities have irregular hours. Good marketing makes no sense if the customer cannot enter your establishment. The same is true of large travel or tourism companies that put people on hold for long periods of time or force them to “climb” a telephone tree. Never have the people who take calls give the impression that it is only a job. If your customers cannot reach you, then your marketing efforts cannot succeed. Appearances and the way your personnel act matter How you interact with the or customer basis matters. That means that personnel must look and speak in a professional way. No customer judges your tourism business on what you say your represent but rather what the customer observes about you. Tourism is all about good service and the best marketing comes about when we do what we say we do, and allow people to live our collective dreams.

Travel and Tourism Marketing as a Form of Art With United States elections to take place in just a few weeks, once again we see marketing as a form of theatrical art. To emphasize this point we need to think about last year’s marketing failures such as the “Bud light” commercials and how this misstep caused the company millions of dollars in sales and goodwill.

Originally passed in January 2024, the latest amendments to the law mandate a compulsory prison term for the offenders. Those convicted of displaying Nazi salutes or hate symbols with the intention of inciting hatred or intimidating others will now be subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of one year in prison. New law also mandates a minimum sentence of three years for the financing of terrorism and a six-year sentence for either committing or planning acts of terrorism. The proposed legislation has reportedly received backing from numerous community organizations committed to addressing hate and discrimination. Although Australian officials claim that this new legislation targets the increasing prevalence of hate speech and extremist actions within the nation, it has also sparked concerns regarding its implications for freedom of expression.

There’s never been a better time to travel to Australia, so come and say g’day! Numerous civil liberties advocates have contended that, although the goal of reducing hate speech is praiseworthy, it is essential for the laws to be implemented with caution to prevent violations of individual rights. However, according to legal analysts, the legislation incorporates measures designed to reconcile the enforcement of the law with the safeguarding of free speech. Specifically, the law prohibits the display of hate symbols when intended to intimidate or provoke hatred against a specific group. Exceptions are allowed for valid purposes such as education, artistic expression, or historical study. Australian police and other law enforcement personnel will also undergo training to ensure the proper enforcement of the new legislation, the government said.

The Bahamas Breaks Tourism Records Welcoming Over 11 Million Visitors,https://eturbonews.com/the-bahamas-breaks-tourism-records-welcoming-over-11-million-visitors/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 6, 2025",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, Investments & Aviation is thrilled to announce the destination welcomed a record-breaking 11.22 million international visitors in 2024, making it the best year ever, exceeding the 9.65 million arrivals in 2023. Despite a few disruptions to the tourism sector with natural occurrences such as Hurricanes Milton and Oscar, the destination flourished. Foreign air and sea arrivals shattered the previous year’s number by 16.2% and 2019 figures by 54.7%. Additionally, foreign air arrivals across the island nation exceeded 1.7 million in line with 2023 performance but ahead 2019 by 3.3%. While The Bahamas is an ideal destination for year-round travel, December 2024 was the best month ever in terms of arrivals with 1.15 million visitors, posting 14% ahead of 2023 and 62% ahead of 2019. An illustration of the destinations’ widespread appeal can also be found in the distribution of these impressive arrival figures. Grand Bahama Island experienced an 8.7% growth in air arrivals, second only to Abaco, with a 11.9% growth over 2023 amounting to a solid return to pre-Hurricane Dorian and pre-COVID levels. The Honorable I. Chester Cooper, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, Investments & Aviation, expressed his pleasure over these achievements. “The Bahamas has not only exceeded its targets but remains a steadfast global leader in the tourism industry and a dominant presence in the Caribbean region.” “These record-breaking achievements are a powerful testament to the tourism marketing strides by the Ministry of Tourism and the supportive dedication of our partners across the destination, who, alongside our passionate locals, continue to offer unparalleled experiences throughout our beautiful and culturally rich islands.” The cruise industry continues to be a cornerstone of The Bahamas’ economy, generating a remarkable $654.8 million in cruise tourism expenditures during the 2023/2024 cruise year, according to a Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association (FCCA) report. When factoring in employment, taxes, and levies, the total economic impact surpasses an astounding $1 billion, underscoring the sector’s vital contribution to the nation’s growth and prosperity. Additionally, the attraction of more than $10 billion of Foreign Direct Investments over the last two years with prestigious global brands such as Rosewood, Six Senses, Montage, Park Hyatt, Bvglari and Four Seasons Residences also played a part in the destination’s success and brand image, especially in the luxury market, in 2024. “We thank our partners and stakeholders across several industries, staff of the ministry of tourism, and the magnificent people of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas who have embraced the mantra that ‘Tourism is Everybody’s Business,’ for this wonderful achievement,” DPM Cooper added. Said Latia Duncombe, Director General of Tourism, “The Bahamas’ exceptional tourism growth reflects our relentless drive to elevate the visitor experience and expand our global reach. These milestones are the result of innovative marketing strategies, strong industry partnerships, and the unwavering hospitality of the Bahamian people. As we build on this momentum, we remain committed to setting new standards in tourism excellence and welcoming even more travelers to our extraordinary islands.” Island Vacations – The Official Website of The Bahamas Experience unmatched island vacations across 100,000 square miles of the world’s clearest water.

Additionally, they have sought a meeting with the new U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy. Boeing To Plead Guilty in a Sweetheart Deal: Victims’ Families React Instantly Boeing in pleading guilty to a Federal felony is significant. Boeing has not been convicted of a felony in decades. If this guilty plea will bring satisfaction to the hundreds of fathers, mothers, daughters, or sons seeking justice is unlikely. The US Justice system is a system designed to bargain over guilt or innocence. Clifford Law Firm already filed an opposition on behalf of the victims’ families. Paul Cassell, the pro bono attorney representing the families and a professor at the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah, dispatched the letter today (Thursday, February 4, 2025) to Bondi, stating, “… families would respectfully request that you reverse the deceptive approach of the previous Administration and direct the Department’s prosecutors to present to the district court all the relevant facts that the Department possesses.” Cassell said, “The families would like to confer about the Department’s plans and particularly to urge the Department to reveal to the judge handling the case all relevant information concerning Boeing’s deadly crime.” The letter highlighted that the families have been urging the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to take appropriate action regarding a new plea agreement that would hold Boeing and its former executives responsible for the criminal actions that resulted in two plane crashes, claiming the lives of 346 individuals. The families have been recognized as crime victims in federal court pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act. The letter indicated that the court determined “that Boeing’s lies to the FAA directly and proximately led to the two plane crashes.” Reject the Boeing Plea Deal! Crash Victims Lawyer Asks Texas Court for Justice B737 Max families of the victims killed in two air crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia had Clifford Law firm file their objections to the expected “sweetheart” plea bargain Boeing was offered to settle causing the death of 366 passengers on the two Boeing 737 Max crashes due to Boeing putting profit over safety when manufacturing these jets. US District Court Judge Reed O’Connor, who is presiding over the criminal case, has established a deadline of February 16 for the Department of Justice’s Fraud Section within the Criminal Division in Washington, D.C., to provide a response to the court concerning the misleading plea agreement made between the DOJ and Boeing. Judge O’Connor previously rejected the initial plea agreement on December 5. In 2022, the Judge determined that Boeing’s falsehoods represented the “deadliest corporate crime in US history.” Furthermore, he found that the Department had infringed upon the families’ rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA) to consult with prosecutors prior to the establishment of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA). In a 12-page opinion issued in December, Judge O’Connor stated that, despite the DPA intended to enable Boeing to rectify its mistakes, it is reasonable to assert that the government’s efforts to ensure Boeing’s compliance over the past three years have been unsuccessful.

St. Martin Island in Bangladesh Bans Tourism for 270 Days,https://eturbonews.com/st-martin-island-in-bangladesh-bans-tourism-for-270-days/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 6, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Bangladesh officials announced a full travel ban to the country’s only coral-rich island located in Teknaf of Cox’s Bazar for a duration of 270 days, effective February 1, 2025. For the longest time, St. Martin Island has been facing various tourism-related hurdles, including overcrowding, rampant litter accumulation, and the deterioration of coral reefs, leading to ongoing demands for enhanced environmental safeguards. Initially, the tourist season in St. Martin, normally lasting from October to March, has been cut to a shorter period from November to January. Overnight stays on the island were completely banned in November, 2024. In December, 2024 and January 2025, a daily limit of 2,000 visitors was also enforced. Finally, St. Martin’s full tourism ban has been enacted by the country’s Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change this month. Tourist ships and ferries were also permitted to operate to St. Martin’s until February 1 only; thereafter, no vessels were allowed to the island. Bangladesh Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change – Bangladesh Biosafety Portal The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is a ministry of the government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh whose role is ensuring the sustainable environment and optimum forest coverage. Previously the ministry was named as Ministry of Environment and Forest. On May 14, 2018, the cabinet changed the name to Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. According to the officials, the complete ban was implemented in order to safeguard the island’s delicate ecosystem that is threatened by a number of environmental issues. However, the enactment of the full tourist ban has also led to serious concerns about the long-term economic repercussions for the island and considerably diminished economic prospects for local residents who rely on the tourism sector. Tourism suspension has raised anxiety among local entrepreneurs, hotel owners, and tourism stakeholders, most of whom depend on the recurring surge of visitors. As Ramadan commences in March, February is regarded as the optimal period for travel to the Island. If the tourism is halted during this time, the local residents will face significant financial setbacks. The New Tourism Hero Hakim Ali makes Bangladesh Proud and is Amazing Mr. H. M. Hakim Ali from Bangladesh, was nominated by Sadia Islam for the Word Tourism Network Hero award, which the WTN jury approved on Friday. Mr. Ali is also the first person to receive the Tourism Hero title as part of the newly introduced Amazing Travel Award by the World Tourism Network in cooperation with eTurboNews.

Tourist Arrivals: How Much is Enough?,https://eturbonews.com/tourist-arrivals-how-much-is-enough/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 5, 2025",N/A,Srilal Miththapala - eTN Sri Lanka,"Tourism is a people-centric industry, driven by evolving needs, trends, and external global influences. To add to this, the complexity the global environment also plays a major role on the decision to travel. Hence tourism forecasting is by no means an easy task. This article examines the importance of adopting research-driven, context-specific approaches to setting tourism targets for Sri Lanka, while taking into account the country’s carrying capacity and global tourism trends. Introduction Sri Lanka Tourism has certainly been on a rollercoaster ride for the past 3 to 4 decades. From the heady days of the 1980s, it suffered setbacks from the long-drawn-out civil war with the industry just managing to keep its head above the water during this time. Additional external shocks such as SARS, Bird flu, 9/11 and more recently Covid, dealt further blows to the growth of Sri Lanka tourism. Just when some steady growth was seen, the deadly Easter attacks occurred, where several tourists were targeted and lost their lives. Although many thought that this was the death knell of the industry, Sri Lanka did bounce back sooner than expected, only to face the Covid pandemic, which affected world tourism right across the spectrum. Despite these adversities, Sri Lanka’s tourism sector showed resilience, only to be hit again by the economic crisis. Given this volatile environment that Sri Lanka has been exposed to, it is no surprise that proper forecasting of tourism growth remains a daunting task. Authorities have often set ambitious targets such as three million tourists by 2025 and even ten million by 2030 without sufficient analysis of the country’s capacity to sustain such numbers. While these goals sound promising, one fundamental factor is often overlooked: the carrying capacity of Sri Lanka. Can an island of just 65,000 km² accommodate such large tourist volumes without significant environmental and cultural consequences? If sustainability is to be the foundation of Sri Lanka’s tourism strategy, realistic arrival targets must be established so we can safely accommodate the visitors without damage to the environment and our culture. Sri Lanka travel Explore Sri Lanka holidays and discover the best time and places to visit. Too Many Tourists? Over tourism refers to the phenomenon of excessive visitor numbers that create human, environmental, and social challenges. It is characterized by the high concentration of tourism activities and the negative impacts it has on destinations. Hence all forms of mass tourism eventually would lead to over tourism. Many global destinations are now experiencing significant backlash from local communities due to uncontrolled tourism growth. Popular destinations such as Barcelona and Amsterdam have faced declining appeal due to overcrowding and its associated negative impacts. Terms like “anti-tourism,” “touristification,” and “tourismphobia” have emerged in response to these challenges. To avoid similar pitfalls, there needs to be proper planning. Firstly, relevant authorities must determine the optimum carrying capacity the destination can accommodate. Subsequently the necessary infrastructure and management strategies must be developed to properly handle these tourist numbers to sustain the carrying capacities. Understanding Carrying Capacity Tourism Carrying Capacity (TCC) is defined by the World Tourism Organization as “The maximum number of people that may visit a tourist destination at the same time, without causing destruction of the physical, economic, socio-cultural environment and an unacceptable decrease in the quality of visitors’ satisfaction” . It should encompass environmental, social, physical and economic aspects of the destination. Given all these impacts, estimation of TCC is a very complex task. The estimation of the TCC even for a specific tourism attraction is complicated, and hence estimating the TCC for the entire country is so much more complex and challenging. Proposed method of estimating ideal tourist arrivals While we do not claim to be experts in this area by any means, but are prospering a simple rudimentary method to arrive at some benchmarks. The study proposes a comparative analysis of global tourist destinations to establish benchmarks for sustainable tourism. It firstly examines tourist footfall (arrivals per km² of land area) in various countries. It will then assess the impact of tourism on these countries as to what extent tourism has affected them. This information will be derived through social media feedback, academic studies, and news reports. Conclusions will then be drawn as to what would be the threshold carrying capacity in relation to the land mass of a country. Tourist footfall per unit area of the country A list of mature tourism destinations has been selected for the study, and their total annual tourism arrivals for 2018 (the best year on record for arrivals to Sri Lanka) are compared to their respective land area. The current available feedback on the status of tourism in each of these countries is then recorded from various social media posts, news reports and academic writings. Based on the current status as seen from these sources, the countries which are facing serious over tourism problems have been highlighted in red. On the other hand, those countries that are not having any serious problems (under tourism) have been identified and highlighted in blue. Countries with emerging issues are marked in green. Country specific analysis of study Costa Rica Land Area: 51,100 km² | Footfall: 65 tourists/km² Costa Rica is considered a leader in sustainable tourism but is now facing over-tourism challenges. Efforts to disperse tourists across the country are underway. Maldives Land Area: 300 km² | Footfall: 5,676 tourists/km² Maldives tourism development is unique because it is widely spread over some 200 islands with their regulation of ‘one island one resort’ concept limiting over tourism. (164 resort islands from a total of 1,200 islands) However, bottlenecks at Male’s airport indicate potential future challenges. It is currently on the brink of facing over tourism issues with various schemes being undertaken to the issue. France and Spain France – Land Area : 551685 km² | Footfall: 162 tourists/km² Spain – Land Area : 506,030 km² | Footfall: 164 tourists/km² Both countries have the largest land mass in the sample set studied but also are very popular tourism destinations with high tourist arrival numbers. They are facing severe over-tourism issues, with local communities voicing opposition. Governments have introduced measures such as tourist taxes and visitor limits. Singapore Land Area: 734 km² | Footfall: 25,204 tourists/km² Despite its very high footfall, Singapore, being a very small country has still managed to have such a large number of tourists without major issues. even though the area of the country is very small. It effectively manages tourism through excellent infrastructure development and planning. However, future challenges may arise. Netherlands Land Area: 41,145 km² | Footfall: 149 tourists/km² A country small in size but with high visitor numbers and is toady labelled as one of the countries facing severe over-tourism issues. The Dutch government has imposed several restrictions on visitors in a bid to curb the influx, Vietnam and Cambodia Vietnam – Land Area: 331,690 km² | Footfall: 47 tourists/km² Cambodia – Land Area: 181,035 km² | Footfall: 34 tourists/km² The footfalls in these two countries is less than 50 per km 2 and hence it could be assumed that the issues of over tourism are not really prevalent. However the research indicates that they should not be complacent as problems of over crowing are beginning to emerge in certain popular tourism hot spots. Kenya Land Area: 582,646 km² | Footfall: 3 tourists/km² A country with a fairly large land mass and relatively low arrival numbers (about nine times the size of Sri Lanka but having the same number of tourist arrivals!) gives it the lowest footfall ( along with India) among the sample set. So although the small footfall indicates that there is no over tourism, there are some reports that some popular attractions such as the wilder beast migration in the Masai Mara is facing over visitation threats. Bhutan Land Area: 38,394 km² | Footfall: 7 tourists/km² Bhutan follows a “high-value, low-volume” tourism strategy, charging substantial fees to limit tourist numbers and protect its environment and culture. It is one of the only countries in the world that has a negative carbon footprint, and has one of the lowest footfalls. Bhutan has managed its tourism extremely well over the years and is a world leader in sustainable tourism development . India Land Area: 2,267,363 km² | Footfall: 3 tourists/km² India has a vast land mass and tourism is widely dispersed among many states who promote their own brand. Hence the footfall of tourists in India is small and does not experience over tourism issues. Malaysia and Thailand Malaysia -Land Area: 330,823 km² | Footfall: 76 tourists/km² Thailand -Land Area: 513,120 km² | Footfall: 75 tourists/km² Although both have large land mass, tourism is not as widely and evenly spread, with large arrival numbers resulting in relatively high with footfalls. There is evidence that pockets of over crowing are already taking place and hence these two countries are at the brink of over tourism. Sri Lanka Land Area: 65,000 km² | Footfall: 36 tourists/km² While Sri Lanka’s overall tourist footfall (36 tourists/km²) is moderate compared to some other destinations, overcrowding at hotspots such as Yala National Park and Sigiriya is already affecting visitor experiences. Poor management of these locations is leading to localized over-tourism, indicating that the country must proactively address potential future challenges. Conclusion: The Optimal Number? From our analysis it is clearly seen that in general an average tourist foot fall of about 65-70 tourists per km 2 is the threshold that a country can accommodate safely without experiencing over tourism. Applying this benchmark to Sri Lanka (65,000 km²), the estimated maximum carrying capacity would be 4.2 to 4.5 million tourists annually. Based on this analysis therefore, Sri Lanka’s maximum safe ‘carrying capacity’ should be about (65,000 x 65-70) = 4.2 – 4.5. Of course there may be variations due to geographic dispersion (e.g., Maldives’ one-island-one-resort model), exemplary infrastructure development and management (e.g., Singapore’s case) and good destination management policies (e.g., Bhutan’s high-value, low-volume approach). Rather than pursuing high arrival numbers, Sri Lanka should prioritize increasing tourism revenue through value-added services and premium experiences. Implementing a well-researched carrying capacity framework will help policymakers balance economic benefits with environmental and social sustainability. A shift from mass tourism (quantity) to quality tourism is essential for ensuring long-term success in Sri Lanka’s tourism industry. Additionally, Sri Lanka must implement policies that encourage geographic dispersion of tourists, regulate visitor numbers at sensitive locations, and enhance sustainable infrastructure development. Strengthening community-based tourism models and incorporating conservation efforts into tourism planning will further enhance the industry’s resilience and long-term viability.

Sri Lanka Homestays: Important in Main-Stream Tourism? There has been a remarkable rise in the number of homestay operators in the tourism market today, especially in the Asian region, including Sri Lanka. They are often labelled as ‘low end’ tourism and perceived to have negative impacts on a tourism destination due to a perception that they lack good hygiene and safety standards. However, an increasing number of tourists are seeking an authentic experience and choosing homestays as their preferred accommodation while on holiday.

25% of Americans Not Ready for Fast Approaching REAL ID Deadline,https://eturbonews.com/25-of-americans-not-ready-for-fast-approaching-real-id-deadline/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 4, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"As we enter 2025, travel continues to be a significant focus for Americans. Recent surveys indicate that 92% of US residents intends to travel, whether by land or air, this year. Furthermore, over half of Americans plan to travel more frequently than they did in 2024, with many prioritizing travel in their financial planning and budgeting efforts. And getting a REAL ID is one thing that would be essential for all of this year’s travel plans to come true. The REAL ID Act of 2005, implemented following a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, set forth minimum security requirements for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards that federal agencies may recognize for activities such as boarding commercial aircraft regulated by the federal government, accessing specific federal facilities, and entering nuclear power plants. The enforcement of the REAL ID Act and its associated regulations strengthens the security of these identification documents and improves the capacity of federal agencies to accurately confirm an individual’s identity. US Travel Industry: May Need Longer REAL ID Extension In a March 26 letter to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, U.S. Travel cited polling data showing that the U.S. had not made significant strides “Congress passed the REAL ID Act in 2005 to enhance security standards for identification, directly in response to the security vulnerabilities highlighted by the 9/11 attacks,” said former TSA Administrator David Pekoske. “Identity verification is foundational to security. I urge those who use a driver’s license or state-issued identity card as their primary form of identification to access federal facilities or board commercial passenger aircraft, to ensure these credentials are REAL ID-compliant. We are committed to engaging with the public, licensing jurisdictions and states to facilitate a smooth transition to REAL ID enforcement beginning May 7, 2025, which this rule supports.” Transportation Security Administration | Transportation Security Administration The final deadline for a Real ID is swiftly approaching and the clock is ticking for those Americans who haven’t obtained one yet. If you intend to travel by air on or after May 7, 2025, it is essential to obtain your Real ID. After this date, a standard driver’s license will no longer suffice for the flights within the United States. Currently, 24% of Americans report not having a REAL ID, and among them, 64% do not know what it is or do not plan to get one before the May 7 deadline. Last month, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has announced the publication of a final rule that establishes a framework for the gradual enforcement of REAL ID requirements by federal agencies. Starting on May 7, 2025, residents of all US states and territories will be required to present a REAL ID compliant license or identification, or an alternative form of acceptable identification, in order to access federal facilities, enter nuclear power plants, and board commercial aircraft. Basically, Real ID is an upgraded form of the conventional state driver’s license or state identification card, with extra features added to assist authorities in combating terrorism and identity theft. According to the Department of Homeland Security, all 50 states and the District of Columbia are currently in compliance with federal Real ID standards. Starting on May 7, 2025, Transportation Security Administration personnel stationed at the ticket document verification area in airports will prevent travelers from accessing the checkpoint without a REAL ID-compliant license or an alternative form of acceptable identification after May 7, 2025. Acceptable alternative forms of identification include a valid passport, a federal government PIV card, or a US military identification card. Children under the age of 18 are not mandated by the TSA to present identification when traveling domestically within the United States. For inquiries related to specific identification requirements for minors, it is advisable to reach out to the airline directly.

ITA Airways Leaves SkyTeam for Lufthansa and Star Alliance,https://eturbonews.com/ita-airways-leaves-skyteam-for-lufthansa-and-star-alliance/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 3, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Italia Trasporto Aereo S.p.A., Italy’s national airline owned by the Italian government and operating under the name ITA Airways, has formally left the SkyTeam alliance and joined Star Alliance as part of its acquisition process by the Lufthansa Group. Established in 2020, ITA Airways emerged as the successor to the defunct Alitalia and is currently offers services to more than 70 scheduled destinations, encompassing domestic, European, and intercontinental routes from its primary hub located at Rome Fiumicino Airport and secondary hub at Linate Airport in Milan. Final ITA-Lufthansa Decision Tempting for Low-Cost Carriers Easyjet and Volotea are the airlines in pole position for the couple of slots that ITA Airways and Lufthansa are willing to leave free as remedies proposed to the EU Commission, which will issue the verdict by July 4 to obtain the green light for the marriage. And now the integration of ITA Airways into the Lufthansa Group has commenced. At a press conference in Rome, Carsten Spohr, the CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, along with Sandro Pappalardo, Chairman of ITA Airways, and Joerg Eberhart, CEO of ITA Airways, announced the first changes and upgrades that would benefiting airline customers. “We want to push ahead with the merger quickly, so that ITA and its passengers, as well as the guests of our other passenger airlines, can quickly benefit from the advantages of an expanded Lufthansa Group,” CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG announced. First and most significant step in the transition takes place today, February 3, 2025, when members of the Lufthansa Group’s Miles and More frequent flyer program will gain the opportunity to earn and redeem miles on flights operated by ITA Airways. Effective immediately, 36 million members of the Lufthansa’s Miles & More program can now earn and redeem miles on all flights operated by ITA Airways. At the same time, the 2.7 million members of ITA Airways’ frequent flyer program, Volare, are now able to earn and redeem their points on all flights operated by Lufthansa, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, and Brussels Airlines. With the commencement of the summer flight schedule on March 30, 2025, travelers with ITA Airways and the Lufthansa Group will benefit from several enhancements: Unified terminal experience in Frankfurt and Munich: The utilization of the same terminal is crucial for ensuring efficient and seamless transfers at the Lufthansa Group’s main hubs. Beginning with the upcoming summer flight schedule, ITA Airways will relocate to the Lufthansa Airlines terminals in both Frankfurt and Munich—specifically, Terminal 1 in Frankfurt and Terminal 2 in Munich. This transition will notably decrease transfer times for passengers. Additionally, at all other group hubs, as well as in Rome-Fiumicino and Milan-Linate, the airlines of the Lufthansa Group already operate within the same terminal areas as ITA Airways. Effective March 30, ITA Airways passengers will also gain full access to approximately 130 lounges operated by the Lufthansa Group and its partners during their travels. Conversely, ITA Airways lounges will also become fully accessible to passengers of the Lufthansa Group on this date. By incorporating ITA Airways flights into the route networks of Lufthansa Group Airlines, customers will benefit from enhanced options and increased flexibility. With the commencement of the summer flight schedule, over 100 flight connections will initially share flight numbers, facilitating easier combinations. These code-sharing arrangements enable the integration of flights from various airlines within the group into a single booking. Once fully operational, this code-sharing will provide ITA Airways passengers with access to more than 250 destinations within the Lufthansa Group. Additionally, Lufthansa Group airline passengers will have the opportunity to book ITA Airways domestic flights to Sicily, Sardinia, Calabria, and Puglia. All codeshare connections will be available for booking starting from February 25 through various global sales channels, including online platforms and the Lufthansa Group and ITA Airways applications. The flight connections between the hubs of the Lufthansa Group (Frankfurt, Munich, Zurich, Vienna, and Brussels) and ITA Airways’ primary airports (Rome and Milan) have been optimized and are now better distributed throughout the day, offering travelers greater flexibility. Coordinated departure times will result in reduced waiting periods and improved connections to long-haul flights. In the future, ITA Airways passengers will also gain access to the full range of benefits offered by the Lufthansa Group. The airline’s entry into Star Alliance, the largest global aviation alliance, is pivotal to this development. Preparations for this transition are already underway, with ITA Airways’ official membership in Star Alliance anticipated in the first half of 2026. Consequently, ITA Airways has initiated its exit from the SkyTeam alliance. Furthermore, the collaboration between ITA Airways and Lufthansa Cargo is set to be rapidly enhanced in the airfreight sector. Initial joint offerings for freight customers will be available on select routes as early as the upcoming summer season. Carsten Spohr, the Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, stated: “Now that ITA Airways has become a member of our airline family a few days ago, we want to push ahead with the merger quickly, so that ITA and its passengers, as well as the guests of our other passenger airlines, can quickly benefit from the advantages of an expanded Lufthansa Group. We are also confident that ITA Airways will realize a profit as early as this year. All in all, we are convinced that today, the start of the integration of ITA Airways into the Lufthansa Group, marks the beginning of a joint success story for customers, employees and shareholders of ITA Airways and the Lufthansa Group.” Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

K-Culture Hub Hanam: Mayor Lee Hyun-jae’s Economic  Tourism Powerhouse,https://eturbonews.com/k-culture-hub-hanam-mayor-lee-hyun-jaes-economic-tourism-powerhouse/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","February 1, 2025",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"K-Culture is turning the city of Hanam, Korea, into an economic culture hub. Hanam’s outspoken Mayor, Lee, aims to drive forward three major development projects—K-Star World, Camp Colbern, and Gyosan New Town—while actively attracting businesses to position Hanam as a leading economic city. Situated in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, Hanam envisions a future where it becomes a global center for culture and economic growth, offering a new model for urban development. What is K-Culture? K-Culture is a short-historied term referring to South Korean popular culture. The term was first coined in the late 1990s 1, when various elements of Korean pop culture—from music to films, dramas, fashion, food, comics, and novels—began to spread overseas, first into neighboring Asian countries, then further afield. What is K-Culture? This article provides a definition and overview of culture Haman City Transportation Hub 5 Minutes to Gangnam, 45 Minutes to Seoul City Hall, and 20 Million Annual Visitors Hanam City boasts a strategic transportation network, with five railways (Subway Lines 3, 5, and 9; Wirye-Sinsa Line; GTX-D/F) and five highways (including the Seoul Ring Expressway and Jungbu Expressway), either operational or under development. Hanam’s well-integrated transport network connects residents and visitors to Seoul’s key hubs, including Gangnam—South Korea’s largest business district—in just 15 minutes by car, and Seoul City Hall, the nation’s political and administrative center, in 45 minutes. Hanam City attracts around 20 million visitors annually, renowned for its vibrant tourist destinations and abundant natural beauty. Popular attractions include Starfield Hanam and the Misa Han River sandy trails. Starfield Hanam, South Korea’s first shopping theme park, is a favorite destination for families. It combines shopping with a wide variety of dining options and cultural experiences. The Misa Han River Sandy Trail, a serene riverside path along the Han River, is one of Hanam’s iconic natural attractions. Ideal for barefoot walks, it offers stunning river views accompanied by the gentle melodies of soothing music. Since Mayor Lee Hyun-jae took office in 2022, Hanam has transformed into a more livable city under his ‘Citizen-Centered Administrative Services’ initiative, which has significantly enhanced the city’s governance. By implementing policies such as the Mayor’s On-Site Office, Open-Door Mayor’s Office, and One-Stop Citizen Service Counter, Hanam City has fostered a more citizen-centric administrative environment. These initiatives led Hanam to rank first in the National Civil Service Evaluation conducted by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety, earning the ‘Best Institution’ designation for the third consecutive year. K-Star World: Poised to Deliver $1.7 Billion in Economic Benefits for Hanam Anticipating a population of 500,000 shortly, Mayor Lee has positioned the K-Star World Project as a flagship initiative. This initiative aims to unlock Hanam’s full growth potential while creating sustainable economic opportunities to support the city’s prosperity for the next 100 years. The K-Star World Project seeks to develop a 1.7 million-square-meter site on Misa Island in Misa-dong into a cultural hub, complete with K-Pop concert venues, film production studios and other facilities. The initiative is expected to create around 30,000 jobs and generate an estimated $1.7 billion in economic benefits. Mayor Lee emphasizes that the global rise of K-Culture highlights the significant potential for the success of the K-Star World Project. According to the Korea Foundation’s 2024 report, the global fan base of the Korean Wave, including K-pop and K-dramas, has grown to approximately 225 million. A 2023 study by the Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange (KOFICE) estimated that the Korean Wave generated $14.165 billion in export revenue, underscoring its potential as a key driver of South Korea’s economic growth. In July 2023, Mayor Lee Hyun-Jae achieved a significant milestone by leading the revision of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport’s guidelines. This paved the way for the removal of Greenbelt (GB) restrictions on Misa Island for the K-Star World project. The revised guidelines allow for lifting GB restrictions, provided measures are established to manage water pollution sources. This achievement was made possible through extensive consultations with the Prime Minister and the Ministers of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Environment. 영문 누리집 10, Daecheong-ro, Hanam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea, 12951 In September 2023, Mayor Lee signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Sphere Entertainment in Las Vegas to bring a state-of-the-art spherical performance venue to Hanam. This marked a significant step forward in advancing the K-Star World project. In November of the same year, Mayor Lee Hyun-jae achieved another milestone when the Emergency Ministerial Meeting on Economic Affairs and the Export and Investment Promotion Meeting announced the ‘Fast-Track Support for Foreign Investments’ policy. This policy reduces administrative procedures from 42 months to 21 months for foreign investment projects, significantly expediting progress. Building on these regulatory and procedural advancements, Mayor Lee has intensified efforts to advance the project. In November 2024, Hanam hosted a pre-bid briefing for private developers at COEX in Seoul, attended by major construction and financial firms. The city plans to launch the formal tender process in the second half of 2025. A City Shaping Its Future Through Cultural Performances: From Busking to Vibrant Festivals Once lacking in arts and culture, Hanam has experienced a remarkable transformation into a vibrant city of creativity and performance under Mayor Lee’s leadership, achieving this shift in just two years. The ‘Music 人 The Hanam’ festival, first held in 2023, attracted over 20,000 – 5 attendees to the Hanam Sports Complex in 2024. Featuring 630 performers, including top-tier musical actors and local artists, the event was met with enthusiastic applause and rave reviews from the audience. The ‘Stage Hanam’ busking series was highly praised. It showcased 47 performances at four key venues across the city: Misa Lake Park & Misa Cultural Street, Hanam City Hall, Wirye Library, and the tentatively named Gamil Neuti Park. These cultural initiatives were instrumental in propelling Hanam to fourth place in the ‘Korea Security Index 2024 – Most Livable Cities’ rankings within the Seoul Metropolitan Area. Events such as busking performances and music festivals have fueled remarkable growth in areas like culture and population influx. Three Landmark Projects to Propel Hanam ’s Growth and Secure Long-Term Prosperity While continuing efforts to grow as a city of arts and culture, Mayor Lee plans to advance three major initiatives to position Hanam as a sustainable and thriving city: the K-Star World Project, the Camp Colbern Urban Development, and the Gyosan New City Development. The Camp Colbern Urban Development Project seeks to repurpose a 250,000-square-meter site in Hasangok-dong, formerly a U.S. military base, into a cutting-edge industrial and mixed-use complex centered on advanced industries, strengthening Hanam’s self-sufficiency. In December 2024, Hanam City and the Hanam Urban Innovation Corporation issued a public tender inviting private-sector participation in the Camp Colbern Mixed-Use Self-Sufficient Complex (tentative name) urban development project. Applications and project proposals will be accepted until March 24, 2025, with plans to establish a Special Purpose Company (SPC) in the second half of 2025 to advance the project. The Gyosan New Town Development Project aims to develop a high-tech industrial hub 568,000-square-meter site encompassing Cheonhyeon-dong, Hang-dong, and Hasachang-dong. The project focuses on cutting-edge industries such as AI, IT convergence, and smart mobility. areas Hanam City plans to draft detailed guidelines for land allocation in Gyosan New Town to utilize the mayor’s recommendation authority effectively. This initiative aims to attract high-quality businesses and further bolster the city’s foundation for corporate investment. Hanam has adopted a comprehensive approach to attracting businesses, strengthening its investment promotion efforts through the Investment Attraction Advisory Group, composed of former senior officials and academics who provide expert guidance. The Business Attraction Center also offers tailored consultations and support, fostering a business-friendly environment. These efforts have yielded significant results, successfully attracting prominent organizations such as Seohui Construction, the Roger9 R&D Center (affiliated with PXG), the BC Card R&D Center, the Korea Franchise Industry Association, Lotte Medical Foundation Bobath Hospital, and Dawoo Industrial Development Co., Ltd. In 2025, Hanam plans to transition its Investment Attraction Advisory Group to focus on on-site activities, launching ‘On-Site Business IR’ initiatives to strengthen communication with potential investors and actively drive its business attraction efforts. Finally, Mayor Lee Hyun-jae, a seasoned expert in economic and policy matters, has held prominent positions such as Presidential Secretary for Industrial Policy, Minister of Small and Medium Enterprises and Startups, Member of the 19th and 20th National Assembly, and Chairman of the Party’s Policy Committee. Under his leadership, Hanam has transformed into a vibrant cultural city, revitalizing arts and performances while driving economic growth by attracting businesses and creating quality jobs. A recent survey by the Chosun Ilbo, in collaboration with the Korea Society Opinion Institute (KSOI), revealed that 68.3% of Hanam citizens believe Mayor Lee is excelling in his duties. In comparison, 75.9% expressed satisfaction with the city’s administrative services. These results highlight the strong trust and support he has garnered from the community.

Age-Biased Statistics: A Lesson From Tourism,https://eturbonews.com/age-biased-statistics-a-lesson-from-tourism/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 31, 2025",N/A,Adriane G. Berg,"Despite their growing numbers and substantial contributions to society, people over sixty are routinely overlooked in statistical analyses that shape community planning and policy decisions. Whether in healthcare, transportation, or education, older adults often remain invisible in the datasets that inform societal priorities. This systemic exclusion perpetuates gaps in services and undermines efforts to build resilient communities capable of addressing the needs of all their members. Tourism is a significant area where this exclusion is starkly evident, where older women, particularly those over eighty, emerge as a crucial demographic. Statistics show that older women in this age bracket spend the most on solo and grandparent travel. However, there is a glaring lack of data on the specific needs of widows, who often outlive their male companions and may face financial challenges due to lower pensions and reduced income post-widowhood. Recent advancements in tourism data collection underscore the importance of inclusive research. For instance, under Saudi Arabia’s leadership, the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) has launched a groundbreaking dataset that aligns tourism employment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This initiative provides detailed insights into employment across the tourism sector, including breakdowns by gender and job type. While commendable, this effort highlights the need for similar approaches that explicitly include older adults. Tourism as a Data-Driven Model The UNWTO dataset represents a significant step in understanding tourism’s economic and social impact. It measures employment across ten primary tourism sectors, offering stakeholders actionable insights to promote sustainability and inclusiveness. Yet, it does not include age-specific data, neglecting older adults who are pivotal as consumers and contributors to the tourism industry. Mature Travelers Got the Money, the Time, and Trust Ageless Tourism Collection The Ageless Tourism collection is a new group of hotels and destinations that better attract, serve, and retain the business of 60+ travelers. The Broader Implications of Exclusion This exclusion of age-specific data extends beyond tourism, affecting the healthcare, transportation, and education sectors. Public policies and services often fail to meet the needs of older adults due to inadequate data on their preferences and challenges. For instance, transportation systems may not cater to their mobility needs, and healthcare services may not adequately address geriatric care. Older women are frequently overlooked in data collection and policy planning, leading to gaps in services and perpetuating inequalities. To build resilient communities, we must include older adults, particularly older women, in data collection, research, and policy planning. The lack of specific data on older adults, especially women, affects various sectors, including tourism, healthcare, and transportation. Investing in older women and ensuring they are included in gender equality initiatives can create a more inclusive and equitable future for all. Home The Ageless Tourism Mission The Mission of Ageless Tourism is to guide tourism-related businesses in accurately assessing the needs and psychographics of the mature leisure and business traveler and in providing the highest level of service in an atmosphere that nurtures and facilitates lifelong travel. A related mission is to promote those tourism-related companies that… Why Age-Inclusive Data Matters Inclusivity in data collection is crucial for building resilient, age-friendly communities. Older adults are active participants in society, contributing through various roles like caregivers, volunteers, and consumers. Their exclusion from data analysis marginalizes their needs and limits opportunities to enhance services tailored to their requirements. Lessons from Tourism for Community Resilience The UNWTO’s initiative demonstrates the transformative potential of data-driven decision-making. To replicate this success across sectors, stakeholders must expand data collection to include age as a key demographic variable. This approach would ensure that policies and services address the diverse needs of older adults, fostering intergenerational collaboration and leveraging technological advancements for targeted interventions. World Tourism Network (WTN) WTN is the Voice for Small and Medium Size Businesses (SMEs) for the Global Travel and Tourism Industry in more than 130 countries. Conclusion The UNWTO’s dataset exemplifies how data can drive progress when inclusive. To build truly resilient communities, including older adults, particularly older women, in data collection and policy planning is imperative. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of societal progress are equitably shared, empowering all members of society to thrive.

Navigating Global Tourist Bans and Restrictions in Summer 2025,https://eturbonews.com/navigating-global-tourist-bans-and-restrictions-in-summer-2025/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 31, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"As tourist bans are increasingly introduced and enforced to address the issue of overtourism all over the world, many travelers are finding themselves unprepared for summer vacation season. Recently, the city of Málaga , Spain, enacted a prohibition on the registration of new vacation rentals in 43 of its neighborhoods, where such rentals constitute more than 8% of the housing stock. Although it fell short of a complete ban on tourism, the city that attracts millions of visitors annually seeks to address the issue of overtourism. Over 12 million tourists visited Andalucía, where Málaga is located, in 2023. Another perfect example of the latest tourist bans trend would be the decision of Nice city officials to ban the mooring of liners with more than 900 passengers starting from July 1, 2025, and leave the port open only for small ships and yachts. Nice Bans Large Cruise Ships from Its Port Starting from July 1, 2025, Nice plans to ban the mooring of liners with more than 900 passengers and leave the port open only for small ships and yachts. According to the city hall, large cruise ships attract mass tourism, which brings in little income, but creates a significant amount of garbage and interferes with the sustainable development of the city. Numerous European towns and ports have been urging for similar limitations on ‘floating buildings’ and ‘low-cost cruises,’ Nice city officials claim. According to cruise industry experts, Cannes, which is also impacted by high levels of cruise tourism, might adopt similar restrictions as those implemented in Nice. Both cities are looking to Venice, Italy, as a model, where since August 2021, cruise ships have been prohibited from traversing the Giudecca Canal and its lagoon, resulting in considerable environmental and social advantages. As overtourism continues to raise significant concerns, it is imperative for travelers to be more aware of their impact this summer. With countries such as Greece and Spain implementing restrictions on access to popular attractions, the demand for sustainable tourism practices is evidently increasing. Instead of merely converging on well-known destinations, tourists should focus on making responsible decisions, such as selecting destinations and companies that promote environmental and cultural conservation. Careful planning will not only safeguard these regions for future generations but also enrich the travel experience by exploring less-crowded, authentic locales. To assist travelers in assessing whether these restrictions may influence their plans for this year, industry experts have compiled a list of destinations that could affect their 2025 vacations, including potential tourist fines and areas that may be off-limits.

Nice , capital of the Alpes-Maritimes department on the French Riviera, is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and sits on the pebbly shores of the Baie des Anges. Founded by the Greeks and later a retreat for 19th-century European elite, the city has also long attracted artists. Former resident Henri Matisse is honored with a career-spanning collection of paintings at Musée Matisse. Musée Marc Chagall features some of its namesake’s major religious works. Currently, the city is an extremely popular tourist destination. According to Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi, together with environmental organizations and conservative politicians, he opposes excessive tourism and the negative impact on the environment. Staring from July 1, 2025, Nice plans to ban the mooring of liners with more than 900 passengers and leave the port open only for small ships and yachts. Nice city officials target the issues of overtourism and pollution through the implementation of a ban, advocating for a form of tourism that is selective rather than imposed. This includes prohibiting ‘floating buildings’ and ‘low-cost cruises.’ According to the city hall, large cruise ships attract mass tourism, which brings in little income, but creates a significant amount of garbage and interferes with the sustainable development of the city. Numerous European towns and ports have been urging for similar limitations on cruise ships, Nice city officials claim. Currently, the Nice authorities are actively working to cancel all cruises calling at the city’s port, despite the fact that such tours were planned and sold in advance. Smaller cruise ships measuring up to 190 meters (623 feet) in length, with a maximum capacity of 900 passengers, are not impacted by the new ban. According to city officials, here are already 124 scheduled arrivals of smaller luxury vessels in Nice for the year 2025, each accommodating between 32 and 700 passengers. Experts suggest that Cannes, which also suffers from excessive cruise tourism, may follow Nice in introducing similar restrictions.

Woefully Insufficient: Spirit Says No to Frontier’s Merger Offer,https://eturbonews.com/woefully-insufficient-spirit-says-no-to-frontiers-merger-offer/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 29, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Frontier Group Holdings, Inc., the parent organization of Frontier Airlines, Inc., has officially announced that it has presented an attractive merger offer to Spirit Airlines, Inc. The offer proposed the merger to be financed through the issuance of newly created Frontier debt and common stock. According to Frontier, the proposed transaction was expected to deliver substantial value to Spirit’s financial stakeholders, surpassing the benefits of Spirit’s independent restructuring plan. By investing in the merged airline, Spirit’s financial stakeholders would have the opportunity to share in the potential growth of a more robust low-cost carrier, while also reaping the considerable synergies that Frontier anticipates from the integration of the airlines’ operations. Bill Franke, the Chair of Frontier’s Board of Directors and the managing partner of Indigo Partners LLC, said, “This proposal reflects a compelling opportunity that will result in more value than Spirit’s standalone plan by creating a stronger low fare airline with the long-term viability to compete more effectively and enter new markets at scale. We stand ready to continue discussions with Spirit and its financial stakeholders and believe that we can promptly reach agreement on a transaction. We are hopeful we can achieve a resolution that delivers significant value for consumers, team members, communities, partners, creditors and shareholders.” “While we are pleased with the strong results Frontier has been able to deliver through the execution of our business strategy, we have long believed a combination with Spirit would allow us to unlock additional value creation opportunities,” said Barry Biffle, CEO of Frontier. “As a combined airline, we would be positioned to offer more options and deeper savings, as well as an enhanced travel experience with more reliable service.” Bankrupt: Spirit Airlines Files for Chapter 11 Protection Spirit Airlines has become the first large American air carrier to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since American Airlines did so more than a decade ago. But today, Spirit Airlines, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November, has declined a “compelling proposal” from Frontier, calling it “woefully insufficient financially.” In today’s filing, Spirit dismissed Frontier’s offer, and expressed its intention to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings by Q1 2025. Three years ago, Frontier and Spirit had already contemplated the merger; however, those negotiations fell through when Frontier’s rival JetBlue presented a Spirit with a more lucrative proposal. But the Spirit-JetBlue agreement was shut down in 2024 when a federal judge ultimately blocked JetBlue Airways’ planned $3.8-billion acquisition.

XB-1 Success Ushers in New Era of Supersonic Passenger Air Travel,https://eturbonews.com/xb-1-success-ushers-in-new-era-of-supersonic-passenger-air-travel/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 29, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"The XB-1 test jet aircraft developed by a US start-up Boom Supersonic has successfully broke the sound barrier for the first time during a flight over California’s Mojave Desert, marking what its developers assert could signify a new chapter in air travel. The experimental plane has become the first privately developed aircraft to attain Mach 1.1 (approximately 770 mph or 1,240 kph) as of today. Piloted by the chief test pilot Tristan ‘Geppetto’ Brandenburg, the aircraft reached supersonic speeds on three separate occasions during the flight. Supersonic Flight Ban Soon Just History? Civilian supersonic flights were banned by the US federal government 50 years ago. Do you know why? According to Blake Scholl, the founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic, the milestone achievement was “a significant day for all of us, for America, for aviation, and for human advancement.” XB-1 supersonic flight means that the technology for passenger supersonic travel is now available, thanks to a small group of skilled and committed engineers having achieved what once required substantial government investment and billions of dollars. The XB-1 test flight was conducted in the same area where, in 1947, US Air Force Captain Chuck Yeager made history as the first pilot to surpass the sound barrier, piloting the experimental Bell X-1 aircraft at a speed of Mach 1.05 and an altitude of 45,000 feet. The XB-1 breakthrough is the first instance of a civil aircraft breaking the speed of sound over the continental United States since the retirement of the Concorde. The Concorde was an innovative supersonic passenger aircraft created through a collaboration between Britain and France. Its maiden flight took place on March 2, 1969, and it commenced commercial operations in 1976. With the capability to cruise at speeds exceeding twice the speed of sound (Mach 2.04) at altitudes reaching 60,000 feet, the Concorde notably shortened transatlantic travel duration, completing the journey from London to New York in approximately three hours. Nevertheless, due to exorbitant operational expenses, limited passenger capacity, and a tragic accident in 2000, the Concorde was ultimately retired in 2003. The XB-1 breakthrough is seen as a major advancement in the development of Boom’s commercial passenger aircraft, the Overture. Capable of accommodating up to 80 passengers, the Overture is anticipated to operate at twice the speed of current subsonic airliners, as stated by Boom. Boom Supersonic has already received 130 orders for the Overture from prominent airlines, including American Airlines, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines.

"El Salvador Tourism Soars on Bitcoin, Violent Crime Drop",https://eturbonews.com/el-salvador-tourism-soars-on-bitcoin-violent-crime-drop/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201068%20601'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 27, 2025",N/A,N/A,"In 2024, El Salvador’s tourism sector has recorded a remarkable 22% growth, welcoming 3.9 million visitors. This sudden spike in tourism has surpassed that of the neighboring countries such as Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Panama, which typically record around 3 million visitors annually. Actually, last year’s increase nearly doubled El Salvador ‘s inbound tourist numbers in comparison to the period from 2013 to 2016. In comparison to 2019, El Salvador witnessed a stunning 40% surge in tourist arrivals. In the last week of December 2024 alone, the country welcomed more than 172,000 international visitors. This substantial increase even led to an acute shortage of available hotel accommodations. The demographics of the visitors have also changed. A greater number of tourists are extending their stays, with 39% originating from the United States, 26% from Guatemala, 16% from Honduras, and the remaining 19% from various other regions globally. Should this upward trend in the country’s travel and tourism continue, it is highly likely to draw increased investment, which in turn would bolster El Salvador’s economy. The surge in inbound tourism has been largely attributed to significant improvements in the safety and security conditions in the country, with El Salvador government enacting severe measures aimed at eradicating widespread gang violence, coupled with a zero-tolerance policy towards organized crime, resulting in the apprehension of tens of thousands of gang members. El Salvador annual homicide rate fell dramatically to 114 in 2024, down from 6,656 in 2015. In December 2024, once dangerous country has recorded only one homicide. These initiatives have significantly elevated El Salvador’s international standing and have enhanced its tourism sector. The improved security situation in the country is making it easier for Salvadoran expats residing abroad, particularly in the United States, to reconnect with their families in El Salvador, while giving a boost to the tourism sector. El Salvador adopts Bitcoin as its legal currency, Bitcoin crashes El Salvador’s government was forced to take the country’s new digital wallet Chivo offline while it feverishly scrambled to boost server capacity. Another major factor contributing to the rise of the tourism sector is the embrace of Bitcoin as a legal tender, that has established El Salvador as a distinctive travel locale for cryptocurrency aficionados.

Furthermore, he has formally declared that the US government will recognize only two genders, male and female, asserting that these classifications are immutable. The Trump administration explained its modifications to diversity and inclusion (DEI) policies as a means to eliminate bias within government programs. An order issued by Trump, which stipulates the recognition of only two genders, is intended to ensure “equal treatment” and calls for “a plan to dismantle the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) bureaucracy,” as stated by a Trump aide. Additional measures regarding DEI that will affect private enterprises are reportedly forthcoming. Inadvertently, the latest policy changes have affected American travelers in need of US passport. In light of the latest developments, the US Department of State has reportedly halted the processing of passport applications that choose ‘X’ as a gender identifier, as reported by a department spokesperson and internal communications. This policy shift reverses a 2022 initiative that permitted applicants to select ‘X’ as a gender marker to support non-binary, intersex, and gender-nonconforming individuals. US will start issuing gender-neutral passports on April 11 In today’s press release, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that starting on April 11, 2022, the US Department of State will offer a third, According to the State Department spokesperson, the issuance of US passports by the Department “will reflect the individual’s biological sex as outlined in the Executive Order.” The official further added that applications for passports featuring the ‘X’ marker have been halted, and the State Department will cease to issue such documents. People who contacted the State Department’s National Passport Information Center with inquiries about the policy were advised to await new guidance before submitting their applications, with additional information expected to be released “in the coming days.” Regarding individuals who have already obtained passports with the ‘X’ marker, the spokesperson indicated that further guidance is “forthcoming,” but according to some media reports, referencing internal communications, US passports bearing the ‘X’ identifier will remain valid under the new policy.

36 People Hurt in Boeing 787 Emergency on Nigeria to USA Flight,https://eturbonews.com/36-people-hurt-in-boeing-787-emergency-on-nigeria-to-usa-flight/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 25, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Six people suffered ‘significant injuries’ when United Airlines flight en route from Nigeria to USA encountered a sudden mid-air disturbance, forcing it to return to Lagos airport last night. United Airlines flight UA613, traveling from Lagos, Nigeria to Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD), experienced severe turbulence that resulted in injuries to passengers and crew members and was forced to make an emergency return to Lagos after declaring an in-flight emergency. Air turbulence: Can your airplane weather the storm? Every day, planes encounter air turbulence, and aircraft need to be able to cope with unpredictable weather. According to a statement from the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, there were 245 passengers and 11 crew members aboard the aircraft. Four passengers and two crew members sustained serious injuries, while 27 passengers and five crew members suffered minor injuries. The aircraft experienced “a technical issue and an unexpected movement” during the journey, the carrier’s spokesperson said, adding that aviation authorities in both the United States and Nigeria have initiated an investigation into the incident’s cause. A brief video, reportedly recorded by passengers aboard the Boeing 787-8 flight and shared on social media, depicts a scene of disorder within the cabin, with trays, food, and various items scattered across the floor. Posts on social media illustrate the disarray, with food and drinks dispersed throughout the cabin. Friday night incident echoes previous troubles recently encountered by other Boeing aircraft. In September 2024, an Air India Boeing 787 traveling from New Delhi to Birmingham, UK was forced to make an emergency landing in Moscow, Russia due to technical difficulties. Two months earlier, an Air India Boeing 777, en route from New Delhi to San Francisco, USA had to mane an unscheduled landing in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, due to concerns of a potential onboard fire. In March, a Boeing 787 flying from Sydney, Australia, to Auckland, New Zealand, experienced a “technical problem during the flight that resulted in significant turbulence.” This incident resulted in injuries to 50 passengers.

France Simplifies Travel Visa Process for Tanzanian Citizens,https://eturbonews.com/france-simplifies-travel-visa-process-for-tanzanian-citizens/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 23, 2025",N/A,Apolinari Tairo - eTN Tanzania,"The French Embassy in Tanzania has taken steps to facilitate visa applications for Tanzanian citizens traveling to France for purposes such as business, education, employment, and tourism. In collaboration with the TLS-contact visa application center, the French Embassy has recently formalized an agreement aimed at simplifying the visa application process for Tanzanian travelers. This partnership between the French Embassy and TLS-contact is designed to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of visa applications for Tanzanian citizens, thereby improving the overall experience for those wishing to visit France. The initiative seeks to streamline the process of obtaining necessary documentation, ensuring that applicants have a seamless and supportive experience. Ms. Anne-Sophie Ave, the French ambassador to Tanzania, stated that through this collaboration with TLS-contact, the French Embassy is dedicated to improving service quality, reducing waiting times, and enhancing the overall accessibility of visa services. The ambassador indicated that the process of welcoming visa applicants, keeping them in a waiting period, and subsequently processing their applications requires a considerable amount of time. When considering the volume of individuals visiting the embassy daily, it becomes evident that both applicants and embassy personnel invest a significant amount of time in reviewing and processing applications prior to the issuance of visas. To address these time-consuming tasks, the French Embassy will collaborate with TLS-contact, which aims to enhance the efficiency of visa service delivery. “We anticipate that this transition will enable a greater number of applicants to obtain appointments more swiftly, potentially allowing them to receive their visas within a two-week period. We will evaluate the initial outcomes soon, but we are hopeful that applicants will experience shorter wait times and more efficient processing,” stated the ambassador. TLS-contact will oversee the initial submission of visa applications, which will considerably decrease processing times for applicants while providing a seamless and supportive experience. Previously, applicants for French visas faced waits of up to three months to secure appointments, which adversely affected travel plans that often necessitate timely visa acquisition. Tanzania Celebrates Europe Day with EU Tourism Message The European Union Ambassador to Tanzania and the East African Community, Ms. Christine Grau, emphasized the importance of this cooperation during the Official Europe Day 2024 Reception in Dar es Salaam, underscoring Europe’s role as Tanzania’s primary development partner. Tanzanian travelers to France primarily consist of students, government officials, business executives, and professional individuals, including members of the clergy. Additionally, there are groups of specialized professionals and individuals embarking on familiarization trips to various French cities and historical sites, which showcase the remarkable history, culture, art, and cuisine of France and Europe. France is renowned for its iconic landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and the breathtaking castles of the Loire Valley, offering visitors an opportunity to immerse themselves in a rich array of architectural marvels. Tanzanian visitors can appreciate world-class art at the Musée d’Orsay and enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of Montmartre, a historic gathering place for renowned artists like Picasso and Van Gogh. Culinary tourism in France allows visitors to savor and even acquire French cooking techniques, which could enhance Tanzania’s culinary landscape. The diverse landscapes of France present countless opportunities for adventure, ranging from the sun-drenched beaches of the French Riviera to the scenic vineyards of Bordeaux and Champagne. Furthermore, traveling to France provides Tanzanians with the opportunity to immerse themselves in a different language and lifestyle, thereby broadening their personal viewpoints. A number of Tanzanian professionals and students utilize the French language in the tourism sector, particularly within tourist hotels and while guiding French-speaking visitors to East Africa.

Chaos at Cape Town and Johannesburg airports,https://eturbonews.com/chaos-at-cape-town-and-johannesburg-airports/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 23, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Purported power outages and fuel shortages have led to disorderly chaos at South Africa’s main air hubs – Cape Town International Airport (CTIA) and OR Tambo International Airport (ORTIA). Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) reported that a compromised cable has affected operations at the fuel depot of CTIA, resulting in flight delays and operational disruptions. Airport operations are presently being supported by generators as repairs are ongoing to completely restore the fuel system. The situation has been temporarily addressed, and refueling activities have recommenced, according to ACSA. ACSA has confirmed that flight schedules have been impacted, and diversions are currently being implemented while the team works assiduously to rectify the issue as swiftly as possible. “We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and thank all passengers for their patience and understanding,” ACSA wrote. ACSA recommended that passengers reach out to their airlines for the latest updates regarding flight schedules. Passengers were also urged to download the ACSA Mobile App to receive real-time notifications and updates regarding their flights. Earlier, ACSA announced that in light of the fire at the National Petroleum Refiners of South Africa (NATREF) refinery on January 4, which has affected national fuel production, the industry has ensured sufficient fuel supply for ORTIA for January and is working collaboratively to prevent any disruptions in February. eTN evaluation: South African Airways and the Johannesburg International Airport Earlier this month I had the opportunity to fly on South African Airways from Johannesburg to Cape Town with a return flight. ACSA reported that ORTIA currently has 27.1 million liters (715,906 gallons) of jet fuel available. The airport consumes approximately 3.6 million liters (951,019 gallons) of jet fuel daily, indicating a remaining stock that will last for about 7.6 days, projected to last until the week ending February 2. The airports company clarified that the distribution of fuel is managed by airlines and fuel suppliers according to their respective commercial agreements. Airlines and suppliers are considering alternative strategies, such as tankering (refueling at different airports), to address their fuel requirements. Furthermore, some airlines have expressed concerns regarding restrictions imposed by their suppliers, which have hindered their ability to secure adequate fuel for their upcoming flights. As a result, they are beginning to formulate alternative plans to refuel at other airports. Airlines have the right to implement measures they deem necessary under the current circumstances, including the practice of tankering from alternative airports, in order to conserve existing fuel reserves until there is clarity regarding the situation in February. ACSA has outlined the following strategies to address the challenges in February: Collaborating with all relevant stakeholders to address the fuel shortage resulting from the NATREF fire and to enhance fuel reserves. Requesting that Transnet prioritize the transportation of fuel supplies from Durban to Gauteng as soon as imported volumes are received. Encouraging the fuel industry to increase stock levels at King Shaka International Airport, which possesses a greater fuel capacity than its daily consumption requirements. ACSA assured airlines, passengers, and all relevant stakeholders that all essential measures are being implemented to uphold standard airport operations and guarantee the secure and continuous supply of jet fuel at ORTIA, while urging fuel suppliers to establish fuel reserves, which refer to the extra fuel carried by aircraft beyond the anticipated needs for a flight. This serves as a vital safety precaution for unexpected situations, including delays, diversions, or sudden alterations in flight conditions.

FiturNext 2025 Kicks Off in Madrid,https://eturbonews.com/fiturnext-2025-kicks-off-in-madrid/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 22, 2025",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"Rosario Sánchez Grau, Spain Secretary of State for Tourism, along with Ignacio Gragera, Silvia Heredia, and Antonio Osuna, mayors of Badajoz, Écija, and Mérida, respectively, stood out among the key voices of FITURNEXT 2025. FITURNEXT, FITUR’s Sustainability Observatory dedicated to promoting good tourism practices, launched its sixth edition, held in partnership with Aqualia, a benchmark brand in integrated water cycle management. Over the course of four days, from January 22-25 at the Madrid International Tourism Trade Fair organized by IFEMA MADRID, the Observatory will highlight the positive impact of tourism initiatives that contribute to more sustainable food management, promote zero surpluses, and apply innovative technologies and circular systems. One of the most important aspects of the inauguration will be the presentation of the report “Towards sustainable food management through tourism,” a document that includes the analysis, carried out by the Observatory throughout this edition, of projects and programs in the private and public sector that promote food sustainability. Francisco Rodríguez, Head of Tourism at Ideas for Change, the entity that developed the research, was in charge of explaining the keys to the report and the research, highlighting that “replicability makes it easier for other actors to adapt something that already exists, to take advantage of the road already traveled and has a multiplying effect.” An award ceremony for the winning initiatives for their contribution to Challenge 2025 The winning projects of this sixth edition are the protagonists, especially during the awards ceremony and the special mention to the finalist initiatives. The inauguration was attended by the Secretary of State for Tourism, Rosario Sánchez Grau, Adela Moreda, member of the FiturNext Advisory Board and Lucas Diaz, Aqualia’s Director for Spain. Marisa Dominguez Contador, Head of Promotion, Planning and Tourism Products of the Regional Government of Extremadura, Àlex Pàmies, Managing Director of Hurtigruten Spain and Marie Lindström, Country Director Manager Too Good To Go Spain, were in charge of collecting the awards for Sustainable Gastronomic Routes of Extremadura, Hurtigruten Cruises and Too Good To Go, respectively. The FiturNext stand then hosted a roundtable discussion on how the tourism industry can reach zero surplus, moderated by Javi Creus, Founder of Ideas for Change, together with Rafael Fernández-Álava, Communication and External Affairs director of Costa Cruceros, Álvaro Sánchez López, Global Director of Sustainability at Iberostar Hotels & Resorts and Rosa Nordfeldt, Director of Sustainability at Air Europa. During the conversation, Fernández-Álava commented on some aspects that need to be improved in the regulation of surplus food in order to give it a new life, “there is a lack of laws and regulations that facilitate food donation.” For his part, Sánchez spoke of the importance of “training staff, especially kitchen staff, to make good use of technology” and to act as a key player in promoting a better way of dealing with waste. Nordfeldt pointed out where they allocate more technological resources, beyond the operational part, in the fuel and the engine to “try to make the flight as efficient as possible.” The last sessions of the afternoon were dedicated to the protagonists: the winning initiatives. Patricia Moreno Ramos, Tourism Technician for Sustainable Gastronomic Routes in Extremadura, and Juan Antonio Bello, Acehúche Cheese PDO Technician, presented the keys to the initiative promoted by the Department of Culture, Tourism, Youth and Sport of the Regional Government of Extremadura, and its rural agrotourism program with three sustainable gastronomic routes (the Cheese, Olive Oil and Iberian Route) that invite visitors to discover the autonomous community in a different way. During the session, the three routes were highlighted, which allow you to discover part of the folklore and culture of Extremadura with unique and unrepeatable experiences, since, as Moreno commented, “not all tourists when they travel do a gastronomic activity.” Pàmies also spoke about the circular food system that they implement on their trips, which reduces the surplus per traveler by using Artificial Intelligence. This use of waste is the result of the Norways Coastal Kitchen initiative that promotes local, seasonal and signature products. Hurtigruten Cruises has become a benchmark in Norway, with natural heritage as an element and providing services and connectivity to the small communities that shape its landscape. “We want our programs to help raise awareness among employees and travelers, so that the visitor becomes an ambassador,” said Pàmies. Finally, Lindström and Pilar Serra, Senior Project Manager at Meliá Hotels International, took part in a panel discussion, moderated by Javier Herrero, Institutional Secretary of Catering Brands, analyzing how an app can connect establishments that have surplus food with users who can buy these products at a reduced price and how the hotel sector contributes to the fight against food waste. On the one hand, Serra pointed out that “food that goes to waste is not due to poor management of the food but also of the entire value chain,” while Lindström said that “citizens are increasingly aware of food sustainability and reducing waste.” The first day ended with the keynote “Prevent. Redistribute. Circular. – Joining global efforts against food waste” with Virginia Fernández-Trapa from UN Tourism. Tourism industry, public policies and commitment to food sustainability This is just the beginning.

North Korea’s Wonsan Kalma Resort Ready for Foreign Tourists,https://eturbonews.com/north-koreas-wonsan-kalma-resort-ready-for-foreign-tourists/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 22, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"North Korea opened its borders to tourists in December 2024, and, according to government officials, in June 2025, ‘tourist city’ of Wonsan Kalma, a large resort on the east coast of the country, will begin to welcome guests. The project, called the “North Korean Benidorm ” by analogy with the famous Spanish resort, offers clean beaches, ‘luxury hotels’ and a variety of entertainment ‘comparable to the best world resorts’. Wonsan Kalma resort complex consists of approximately 150 hotels, dining establishments, and attractions that are currently under construction along the 5-kilometer stretch of Myongsasimni beach, located near the city of Wonsan on the eastern coast. There hotels, restaurants, spas, shops, a water park, a cinema, a stadium and even an airfield. A special feature of the resort complex is the view of the missile test site where ballistic missiles are tested. North Korea International Tourism Resumes in December US government-announced prohibition on travel to North Korea for US citizens took effect on September 1, 2017, and has been renewed annually since. The construction was planned to be completed in 2020, but the deadline was postponed due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The resort is located 160 kilometers (100 miles) from Pyongyang, in a picturesque bay among the Kumgangsan Mountains. Nearby is the Masikryong ski resort and hotel. The resort is suitable for tourists with different income levels: there are both budget options and VIP cottages with luxurious amenities. A full seven-day tour with flights, meals and excursions will cost $2,000 per person. The swimming season lasts from June to September. The Wonsan Kalma resort is positioned as a symbol of the country’s economic breakthrough. North Korea actively promotes tourism that is not subject to UN sanctions and uses it to attract foreign currency. In 2024, the state tourism agency released an advertising video featuring foreign tourists enjoying their vacation. North Korean officials’ initial focus was primarily on attracting South Korean and Chinese tourists, when the construction of the resort started seven years ago . But, despite the amicable diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China and the reopening of North Korea’s borders after the global COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese tourist groups have failed to materialize. The prospect of luring back South Koreans tourists remains highly improbable without a significant political advancement. However, the newly arrived Russian tourists who have already participated in several limited day trips to Wonsan Kalma are now the focus of North Korean authorities, although, the Russians represent a significantly smaller potential revenue stream than the Chinese or South Korean visitors.

"Nepal Raises Everest Climbing Fee from $11,000 to $15,000",https://eturbonews.com/nepal-raises-everest-climbing-fee-from-11000-to-15000/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 22, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Climbing Mount Everest is a dangerous and challenging endeavor that involves traveling to high altitudes and acclimatizing to the reduced oxygen levels. Every year, numerous climbers from all over the world attempt to ascend Mount Everest and various other peaks in the Himalayas. Those who have climbed Everest recently are saying that the mountain is becoming drier and rockier, with snow and other forms of precipitation diminishing significantly. Climbers Turn Everest Into Giant Toilet Drowning in Feces Referred to as ‘Garbage Mountain’ in the year 2000, Everest now stands as a stark reminder of the toll humanity has taken on the environment. Nepalese authorities are also facing criticism from mountaineering community for permitting an excessive number of climbers on Everest while taking insufficient measures to maintain cleanliness and ensure the safety of those ascending the mountain. Things are about to change. Nepal announced that it will significantly increase the price of permits for foreign tourists seeking to climb Everest. Revenue generated from permit fees and expenditures by international climbers serves as a vital source of income and employment for this impoverished nation, which hosts eight of the fourteen tallest mountains globally. The new rates have already been approved by the government. In the spring, climbers will pay $15,000 instead of the current $11,000 for the ascent. The autumn ascent will cost $7,500 instead of $5,500, and the winter one will increase from $2,750 to $3,750. The Nepalese Ministry of Tourism clarified that tourists who have already paid for a spring reservation will follow the old rules. The new prices will come into effect on September 1. In addition, the permit validity period will be reduced from 75 to 55 days. New environmental requirements have also been introduced: climbers must use biodegradable waste bags, and the list of permitted equipment will be strictly regulated. Officials say the changes are aimed not only at increasing revenue but also at cleaning up Everest’s accumulated trash. The last revision to permit fees was nine years ago, when a fee was introduced for each climber rather than a group. The annual number of individuals attempting to ascend Mount Everest fluctuates, typically falling between 700 and 1,000 attempts. The success rate for reaching the summit of Everest generally lies between 60% and 70%. Annual summit statistics: 1950s–1980s: A limited number of successful ascents each year 1990s: 100–150 successful ascents annually 2000s: 200–300 successful ascents annually 2010s: 500–600 successful ascents annually 2018: A record 800 individuals reached the summit 2019: A new record of 877 individuals summited 2023: Approximately 600 individuals reached the summit 2024: An estimated 860 individuals achieved the summit.

In a statement provided to the media, the Russian Interior Ministry noted that on January 20, law enforcement received a notification concerning a public disturbance at the establishment. Preliminary reports indicate that a man and a woman, both under the influence of alcohol, were disrupting public order at a café. Law enforcement officers who responded to the incident apprehended the individuals and transported them to the police station for further investigation, as stated by the department. According to Russian law enforcement, the detained man is a citizen of the United States. The altercation reportedly stemmed from a debate about US presidents, with the American supporting Joe Biden and his Russian companion was apparently trolling him by advocating for Donald Trump. While consuming alcohol at the bar, US visitor engaged in an argument with his Russian female companion over the merits of Biden versus Trump. He attempted to persuade the woman that Biden would have been a much better choice, and when she disagreed, their argument escalated, resulting in “aggressive behavior” that caused “property destruction”. Local media reports have claimed that the individuals involved are John Jordan, a 44-year-old US national, and a 31-year-old resident of Moscow named Ruslana. According to the bar staff, the couple communicated in English and had been drinking for approximately four hours, during which they consumed significant quantities of alcohol. Bar employees have reportedly attempted to mitigate the situation but to no avail. Following the arrival of law enforcement and an ambulance, the individuals were transported to the toxicology unit. Moscow police officials are currently withholding any additional information due to “ongoing investigation”.

He said the procurement process had begun and construction for the laying of the pipes would commence in three months. He further explained that Negril accounted for approximately 20% of Jamaica’s stopover visitors, adding that the water supply project, which would be the biggest investment by the government in water development, was aimed at giving back to the town.

This is how we build sustainable tourism – by ensuring our communities grow along with our visitor numbers,” Minister Bartlett stressed. Mr. Bartlett welcomed the addition of the Red Stripe Experience to Jamaica’s list of attractions, noting: “Through art, music and digital displays, locals and visitors alike will journey through the almost 100-year history of this iconic brew, all while experiencing the authentic Jamaican culture and people that make our island unique.” Minister Bartlett pointed out that since 2017 the Tourism Enhancement Fund (TEF) had committed over J$500 million to various projects in Negril, including road rehabilitation, beautification efforts, drain cleaning and the renovation of the Negril Fire Station.

The eTA serves as an entry permit, enabling the Kenyan government to identify travelers before their journey. The system required all travelers, including minors, to secure prior authorization before visiting Kenya. The fee for this permit is $30 (around Sh3,880) and it permits a single entry, allowing for a maximum stay of 90 days. The eTA functions as a semi-automated system that assesses the eligibility of visitors wishing to travel to Kenya. It grants permission to travel and is sanctioned by the Government of Kenya. Confusion Surrounds Kenya Travel: Now Visa-Free? | eTN | 2024 Kenya’s recent implementation of the Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) system on January 5th has stirred confusion within the Kenya travel industry as well as the global travel industry regarding its implications for entry into the country. Today, Kenya’s Cabinet has authorized a proposal to exempt travelers from Botswana, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Zambia, Comoros, Eritrea, and the Republic of Congo, and others from the eTA, aiming to promote open skies policies and enhance tourism growth. Citizens and residents of Somalia and Libya, however, have been excluded from the waiver over security issues. Under the revised framework, the majority of visitors from Africa will be permitted to remain for a duration of up to two months. In contrast, citizens from East African Community (EAC) member countries will continue to enjoy the benefit of a six-month stay, in line with the EAC’s protocols for free movement. To improve the system further, the Cabinet has implemented a fast-tracked eTA processing option, allowing travelers to obtain immediate approval. The maximum processing time for eTA applications will be limited to 72 hours, depending on operational capacity.

This influential event will run from January 22 to 26, 2025 in Madrid where eTurboNews is also participating. Along with providing international tourism stakeholders the venue to showcase their offerings, foster new working relationships, and explore tourism opportunities, the Jamaica Tourism Minister has a full lineup of meeting with key tourism players including Sebastian Ebel, CEO of the TUI Group; Encarna Pinero, CEO of Grupo Pinero, operators of the Bahia Principe Hotels & Resorts; Mark Hoplamazian, President of Hyatt Hotels, and representatives from development firm Invertol. Along with other activities such as attending an award ceremony by Grupo Excelencias, the Hon. Bartlett will be participating in an anniversary event hosted by UN Tourism at the Four Seasons Hotel.

Dr. Walter Mzembi, candidate for the Republic of Zimbabwe in 2017, supported by the African Union, lost second to the current secretary General Zurab Pololikashvili due to manipulation and irregularities, some clearly called fraud. Every candidate competing for this post in the 2025 election should be reminded of Dr. Mzembi’s vision, and hopefully learn from it. The key to win for candidates competing against the third term by Pololikashvili is to unite and share the needs for this huge and diverse global task -leading travel and tourism. We invite all candidates to share their statement.

"World Tourism: The Good, The Bad, and The New",https://eturbonews.com/world-tourism-the-good-the-bad-and-the-new/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 20, 2025",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"Often times, travel and tourism are the number one sources of income revenue and job opportunities in private as well as government and not-for-profit agencies. Nations such as Seychelles, The Bahamas, Barbados, and Jamaica quickly come to mind where tourism tops the list as the main economic driver for the country. Is This a Negative or a Positive? When a country is so fiercely reliant upon tourism to fulfill economic demands, does that dependence make them vulnerable to potential global situations? Think of how COVID-19 nearly shut down the travel and tourism industry. The fall of economies can affect whether or not people even travel in the first place. Natural disasters can cause travelers to cancel plans to that destination affecting industries from airlines to hotels to restaurants. Beyond money, overtourism can lead to the degradation of the environment. With large numbers of tourists often comes abuse of natural resources, excessive pollution, and damage to fragile ecosystems which result in not only long-term natural effects but once again circles back to additional economic resources being funneled into fixing the damage that has been done. Case in point: the movie The Beach had so many people traveling to Maya Bay in Thailand that the coral reef and other marine life were damaged causing the Thai government to close the bay to all visitors in 2018. It remained closed for restoration for 4 years until January 2022. On the Positive Flip Side The more tourists there are, the more money that governments have to spend on things like infrastructure. This benefits not only future visitors but residents as well with better roads, transportation options, and airports, as well as better public facilities including such things are cultural programs. Tourism is often times the proponent of a revitalizing of cultural venues to promote traditions and heritage from within the destination. Hinging upon culture customs, crafts often are the catalyst for community income as tourists especially enjoy purchasing cultural handmade items to bring home as souvenirs from their travel adventures. Along with all these increases in venues, transportation, and events, comes staffing needed to run the restaurant, or the museum, or the craft fair, or drive the city tour bus, or man the additional airport security check ins. You get the picture. Expansion of any sort normally involves some sort of human power, even areas not normally thought of, such as farm workers that need to keep up with food demand by more restaurants opening up, construction workers building that new hotel, and the like. Just Remember to Make it Sustainable As with everything else in life, we are only as good as our last deed. So this should be so with tourism as well, in that it’s great to have a growing industry, as long as we make sure we can keep up with the demand. In a word – as long it is sustainable. A booming tourism economy requires a commitment that is just as big to the careful management of tourism’s impact on the destination. Conservation is key to protecting tourism as an economic asset and may be achieved through tourism that is community based so that local input is taken into account when planning a project and development of entities that will gain from tourism activities. This is where not putting one’s eggs into one basket will help, as diversifying tourist activities will help to ensure not one particular activity will erode away at what is essentially a shared treasure. Options might include not just sand and sea, but cultural tours, adventure jaunts, restaurant tastings, musical events, and so on. The Way We Will Travel Join the session on transforming global travel amidst shifting expectations, geopolitics, and climate change at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2025. Learners Take Heed As economies shift industry impacts, nations new to the travel and tourism industry should take heed as the economics of this industry are a recipe that should be respectfully followed. On the other hand, the sharing of information and stories by industry newcomers is also important. The WEF has its sites set on this topic as it invited the Minister of Tourism for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, His Excellency Ahmed Al-Khateeb, to enlighten a conversation about global tourism at the forum. Saudi Arabia only opened its borders to tourism just a little over 5 years ago and is breaking its own tourism goals. The country has become one of the world’s fastest-growing tourism destinations, surpassing its own 2030 goal of 100 million tourist arrivals by achieving just that last year in 2023. They should be listened to with great enthusiasm as it always benefits to have a fresh set of eyes on any situation. A new briefing paper on “The Future of Travel and Tourism: Embracing Sustainable and Inclusive Growth” was released at WEF in collaboration with the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Tourism that describes how a destination makes itself ready for tourists as well as cross-sector collaboration and transformative trends in the sector.

Hard Rock Hotel Bali: Party Resort Improvements to Boost Tourism,https://eturbonews.com/hard-rock-hotel-bali-party-resort-improvements-to-boost-tourism/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 20, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Located in southern Bali, Indonesia, Kuta is a major tourist destination. It functions as an urban village and serves as the administrative center of Kuta District within Badung Regency. It is integrated into the Denpasar metropolitan area and is situated about 7.5 miles south of the central region of Denpasar. The tourism party city of Kuta was among the first locations in Bali to experience significant tourism growth and continues to be a key beach resort, attracting visitors from around the world. The area is internationally recognized for its expansive sandy beach, a diverse range of accommodations, numerous dining establishments, and vibrant nightlife, drawing many prominent surfers, particularly from Australia. Additionally, it is conveniently located near Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali. Opened on May 15, 1998, Hard Rock Hotel Bali was the first Hard Rock Hotel in Asia and has been a pioneer of its kind as an entertainment hotel in the region. Described on Tripadvisor as “First Impression: A big party place,” this music-themed resort was the first party hotel on the island of Bali in its heyday, drawing visitors and locals looking for fun. With the area recently becoming less popular with tourists, the hotels are focusing on various improvements and strategies to stay in sync with the latest industry trends while trying to attract more guests and increase the visitor flow. Beyond Bali: Indonesia Trying to Attract Tourists to Other Destinations Whenever you think about Indonesia, what’s the first picture that comes to your mind? Perhaps you are thinking about enjoying a 360-degree ocean view from your hotel room in Bali. This location in Kuta has been shifting. The glory times for the Hard Rock Hotel Bali are also disappearing. Now Hard Rock Hotel Bali achieved a significant milestone highlighting its commitment to sustainable practices. It has been certified by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC), making it the second hotel in Indonesia to receive this prestigious recognition. The Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) is a non-profit entity that establishes and disseminates worldwide standards for sustainable tourism practices. The GSTC-certified designation is granted to tourism enterprises with a robust commitment to social responsibility, environmental stewardship, cultural impact, and economic viability. Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) – the international accreditation body for sustainable tourism certification Managing global standards for sustainable travel and tourism; accreditation body for sustainable tourism certification… Hard Rock Hotel Bali has consistently demonstrated a profound dedication to sustainability. Since its inception, the hotel has prioritized implementing the brand’s four core principles: Love All Serve All, Take Time To Be Kind, Save The Planet, and All Is One. The establishment works tirelessly to uphold a responsible and sustainable presence within the tourism sector. A variety of sustainable initiatives are integrated into the operations of Hard Rock Hotel Bali, including energy efficiency measures such as the installation of energy-saving lighting and appliances, as well as a cutting-edge water filtration system designed to reduce dependence on single-use plastic bottles. The hotel also emphasizes waste reduction through recycling, upcycling, and composting efforts. Additionally, it actively supports local educational institutions through various programs aimed at cultural preservation. Hard Rock Hotel Bali further engages in sustainable practices by partnering with several foundations in Bali, focusing on initiatives such as providing financial aid for medical assistance to underserved communities, distributing surplus food, and minimizing carbon footprints through regular mangrove planting activities in collaboration with the Wanasari Fishermen Group. Moreover, the upcoming annual fundraising event, the Rock n’ Run Charity Fun Run 2024, aims to facilitate the planting of over 3,000 trees in Kintamani, Bangli, and Rendang village, Karangasem this year. As stated by Shane Coates, General Manager, sustainability has consistently been a fundamental aspect of Hard Rock Hotel Bali’s ethos. “This certification signifies a significant milestone in implementing sustainable practices. We believe that this internationally recognized accolade will enhance the confidence of our guests when choosing Hard Rock Hotel Bali for their stay, enabling them to make informed decisions and support responsible tourism.” Initiatives for sustainability can commence with minor actions and develop alongside the guest experience. By promoting collective awareness among various stakeholders—including staff, hotel management, tourism industry participants, and travelers—we can broaden our potential to cultivate a positive legacy for future generations.

World Monuments Fund: Space Tourism Threatens Moon Historic Sites,https://eturbonews.com/world-monuments-fund-space-tourism-threatens-moon-historic-sites/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 20, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Every two years, the World Monuments Fund (WMF) , a private, international, non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of historic architecture and cultural heritage sites around the world through fieldwork, advocacy, grantmaking, education, and training, releases a list of 25 sites endangered by climate change, tourism, conflict, and natural disasters. The organization’s advocacy has resulted in enhanced flood defenses in Venice, the restoration of the Mahadev Temple in Nepal, and the safeguarding of various temples within Cambodia’s Angkor Wat complex. The most recent edition of the list encompasses sites across 29 countries, including the heavily damaged urban area of Gaza and the Swahili Coast, which extends across four East African nations. Notably, it also marks the inclusion of the first-ever extraterrestrial heritage site. The WMF has, for the first time, included the Moon on its list of endangered historic sites, highlighting the threats posed by commercial space travel to the landing sites of the initial lunar missions. Space Tourism: The Final Frontier Increases in Popularity For some, mainly those with excessive discretionary funds, normal travel experiences are ho-hum. That’s where space tourism steps in. “As a new era of space exploration dawns, the physical remnants of early Moon landings are under threat, jeopardizing these enduring symbols of collective human achievement. On July 20, 1969, when the Apollo 11 mission landed in the Sea of Tranquility, 650 million people on Earth watched humans walk on the Moon’s surface for the first time,” the World Monuments Fund stated on its website. “Tranquility Base is one of over 90 historic landing and impact sites that mark humankind’s presence on the Moon’s surface and testify to some of our most extraordinary feats of courage and ingenuity,” the organization added. ”Exploitative visitation, souveniring, and looting by future missions and private lunar exploration could eventually compromise this truly unique cultural heritage, removing artifacts and forever erasing iconic prints and tracks from the Moon’s surface,” the statement warned. The Apollo 11 astronauts abandoned 106 artifacts at the Tranquility Base landing site, which comprise the lunar module, various scientific instruments, and the famous boot print of Neil Armstrong. Although Moon landing locations have remained in a relatively stable state due to the lack of wind and flowing water on the Moon’s surface, the organization cautioned that “a recent resurgence of interest in human activity on the Moon, coupled with a growing commercial space industry,” poses a threat to their preservation. Today, no specific international accord exist dedicated to the protection of lunar exploration heritage. Nevertheless, two years ago, several archaeologists and scientists established the International Scientific Committee on Aerospace Heritage with the aim of advocating for the preservation of what they refer to as “humanity’s tangible and intangible aerospace heritage.” This organization has urged global leaders to create a formal treaty that would safeguard lunar locations from commercial exploitation. SpaceX successfully launched two lunar probes last week, as preparations continue for the return of humans to the Moon with NASA’s Artemis III mission, which has faced multiple delays and is now scheduled for 2027, while the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program is set to undertake three uncrewed missions from 2025 to 2028, and the China Manned Space Agency has plans for crewed lunar landings by 2030. Currently, there are no commercial tourist Moon landings on the agenda, but SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin have all expressed their intentions to engage in space tourism, offering lunar travel to paying customers.

Apparently, the purpose of the new ad, that depicted an aircraft appearing to approach the Eiffel Tower in Paris, was to commemorate the resumption of flights to the French capital after a four-year pause caused by issues related to the licensing of PIA pilots, but it immediately ignited widespread ridicule on social media. One user commented, “All they needed to add was Allahu Akbar,” while numerous others criticized its alarming similarity to the 9/11 attacks, during which Islamist terrorists targeted the World Trade Center and the Pentagon using hijacked commercial airliners. Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the September 11 attacks on the USA, was located and eliminated by United States special forces in Pakistan in 2011. Meanwhile, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the principal coordinnator of the hijackings, was apprehended in Pakistan in 2003. Omar Quraishi, a former adviser to the ex-foreign minister of Pakistan, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, wrote: “Who designed this? Who or which agency manages its social media accounts? Did the airline management not vet this?” “Do they not know that PIA is an airline owned by a country often accused of supporting terrorism?” he added. The latest ad blunder is not the first instance of a seemingly foreboding PR campaign by PIA. In 1979, the airline promoted its Paris-New York route by placing a half-page advertisement in France’s Le Point newspaper, which depicted the shadow of a Boeing 747 cast upon the glass facade of the renowned Twin Towers. In more recent times, the airline faced ridicule when its ground staff performed a goat sacrifice on the tarmac for good fortune prior to a domestic flight in 2016. At that time, the airline maintained that the actions of its staff were taken independently and that such ritualistic slaughter does not align with company policy. In the meantime, Pakistani Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar criticized Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) for its “foolishness” in releasing the promo ad and told the country’s parliament that Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has already ordered an investigation into PIA dubious advertisement campaign. Pakistan International Airline: Amazing History, but in Serious Trouble? Pakistan International Airlines, known as PIA has a history it can be proud about. In the last few days, this airline seems to be in trouble.

Will Los Angeles Still Host 2025 Oscars Amid Catastrophic Wildfires?,https://eturbonews.com/will-los-angeles-still-host-2025-oscars-amid-catastrophic-wildfires/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 16, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Devastating wildfires ravaging Los Angeles have cast a doubt on whether the city would be able to host this year’s Academy Awards, but, according to local sources, citing “senior figures” within the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , the 97th Academy Awards ceremony is set to proceed as planned. Catastrophic Southern California wildfires that started last week have caused extensive destruction. At least 25 people have perished, and the flames have devastated over 40,000 acres. More than 12,000 structures have been lost, leaving entire communities in ruins. LAPD: Run for Your Lives in Los Angeles: Fires and Winds! All of Los Angeles has been hit by heavy winds and devistating fires broke out in Pacific Palisades forcing the close of famous Highway One, and triggering mandatory evacuation from Malibu to the edge of the City of Santa Monica. This week, Bill Kramer, the CEO of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, along with President Janet Yang, reconfirmed that the 97th Oscars will take place on March 2 and stated that the nominations for the Oscars will be disclosed on January 23, having been rescheduled from their original dates of January 17 and January 19. The rescheduling of the Oscar nominations has led to widespread speculation regarding the possibility of the Academy canceling this year’s ceremony. Additionally, phony ‘photos’ depicting the iconic Hollywood sign and surrounding grassy areas ablaze, circulating on social media have fueled further rumors concerning a potential threat to the annual event. Citing ‘anonymous sources’, UK tabloid The Sun reported that the Academy has established a special committee, that includes such celebrities as such as Tom Hanks, Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, and Steven Spielberg, to monitor the situation on a daily basis. The tabloid also implied that a “contingency strategy” is in place, which may be enacted to cancel the highly anticipated event should a “life-changing event” impact the broadcast of the show. Senior Academy figures dismissed the possibility yesterday, asserting that the organization’s board of governors, consisting of 55 members – none of whom were mentioned by The Sun – is the sole authority on the Academy’s course of action. According to earlier reports, the board, which includes four members who have been displaced by the fires, has canceled this year’s Oscar Nominees Luncheon and postponed the Scientific and Technical Awards.

"Traveler Stopped at Moscow Airport with $70,000 Worth of Human Hair",https://eturbonews.com/traveler-stopped-at-moscow-airport-with-70000-worth-of-human-hair/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 15, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Moscow Domodedovo Airport’s customs officers have seized 50 kilograms (approximately 110 pounds) of human hair valued at almost $70,000 from a traveler who was trying to smuggle it in his luggage on a flight from UAE. According to Russian customs press service, a man arrived to Domodedovo Airport in Moscow on a flight from Dubai and had initially passed through the airport’s ‘green’ (customs-free) corridor, designated for passengers without any goods to declare, but was subsequently pulled for further inspection during a luggage check. After discovering seven plastic bags filled with 300 bundles of natural hair in different colors and styles, customs officials have charged passenger with breaching Russian customs declaration laws, and the court subsequently levied an administrative fine exceeding $32,000. The passenger, who claimed to be a professional hairstylist returning from an international beauty festival, stated that he was not aware of the customs declaration requirements. He claimed that the hair value was approximately $3,000, and that he intended to utilize it for the production of wigs, extensions, and hairpieces for his Russian clients. Customs officials at major Moscow airports have been reporting numerous similar incidents lately. Recently, a traveler at Sheremetyevo Airport has been stopped while in possession of fragments of mammoth tusks and now faces the possibility of a five-year prison sentence along with a fine that could reach up to $10,000. In July, another airline passenger was detained at Domodedovo Airport while attempting to transport 11 walrus tusks to Cairo, Egypt. According to him, he had purchased them at a flea market for use as legs for furniture. However, experts later confirmed that these tusks possessed considerable cultural significance, as they originated from an Atlantic walrus, which is listed in Russia’s “Red Book” – an official governmental register that lists rare and endangered animal species.

It is situated in Domodedovo, Moscow Oblast, approximately 42 kilometers (26 miles) to the south-southeast of Moscow’s city center. This airport facilitates regular flights within Russia and to various destinations in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, ranking as the third largest airport in Russia, following Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow and Pulkovo Airport in Saint Petersburg. Domodedovo Airport is recognized as one of the twenty busiest airports in Europe, having accommodated 21.2 million passengers in 2022.

Airlines for America President and CEO Announces His Retirement,https://eturbonews.com/airlines-for-america-president-and-ceo-announces-his-retirement/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 14, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"After serving for 14 years as the President and CEO of Airlines for America (A4A), the foremost association representing passenger and cargo carriers, Nicholas E. Calio announced today his intention to retire from the organization at the conclusion of 2025. During Calio’s tenure, A4A underwent a rebranding and sharpened its mission to serve as a powerful advocate in shaping legislative and regulatory frameworks that enhance air travel and cargo shipping for consumers. Renowned for his consensus-building skills, Calio revitalized the association by fostering collaboration among airlines, labor unions, Congress, the executive branch, key government agencies, and international governments to advance the safety, security, and health of the U.S. airline sector. Airlines for America to Congress: No additional taxes Airlines for America (A4A), urged the U.S. Congress to reject the proposed tax hikes on air travel that are included in the President’s FY2021 budget request. “All of this has been possible because of A4A’s strong Board of Directors. I have been fortunate to work for and with some of the sharpest minds in business over the past 14 years and blessed with A4A Board Chairs Scott Kirby, Robin Hayes, Gary Kelly, Brad Tilden and Doug Parker, some of whom served twice. They have been willing to commit their time and to put aside the individual interests of their companies on behalf of the larger industry,” said Calio. “Together, we have accomplished so much for so many, and I have learned from their counsel and benefited from their enduring friendship. I am thankful to have worked alongside such a dedicated and strategic Board.” Calio has played a pivotal role in several FAA reauthorization negotiations and was crucial in preventing a complete crisis during the implementation of the 5G C-Band in 2022. His leadership throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was vital in preserving the industry from devastation, as he collaborated closely with Congress, labor organizations, and various stakeholders to establish the Payroll Support Program, successfully securing $60 billion through the CARES Act to maintain employment for airline workers. “We worked with both sides of the political aisle, both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, as well as labor, suppliers, manufacturers, various associations and others,” Calio said. “Our Board members were unified and laser focused on saving countless jobs, their companies and the U.S. airline industry.” Calio concurrently engaged with Harvard University’s National Preparedness Leadership Initiative (NPLI) and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health to undertake independent research focused on air quality within aircraft. The findings indicated that, due to multiple layers of protection, the risk of COVID-19 exposure during air travel is exceedingly low. In recent times, Calio has been vocal about the need to tackle the shortage of air traffic controllers, emphasizing that proactive measures are necessary to address retirements and attrition challenges faced by the FAA. He has highlighted the critical need for innovative strategies in recruitment, hiring, and training, including revitalizing the Collegiate Training Initiative (CTI) program. Furthermore, Calio has underscored the importance of ensuring that the FAA’s Facilities & Equipment budget is adequately funded and that the agency possesses the flexibility to confront urgent modernization challenges, particularly as the US airline industry experiences unprecedented levels of air travel, employs one million individuals, and transports millions of tons of cargo globally, all while maintaining its status as the safest mode of transportation. Calio, a member of the association since 2011, is set to retire upon the conclusion of his contract. He will remain in his leadership role and support the board in the process of finding his replacement. The search for Calio’s successor will be led by A4A Board Chairman and United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, along with Board Vice Chairman and American Airlines CEO Robert Isom, and will commence without delay. A4A Board Chairman and United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby commended Calio’s tenure saying: “Nick has been a leading voice for the airline industry and aviation in general during a time of both challenge and opportunity. He has been a strong advocate for our businesses, our employees and our customers in the halls of Congress, in the administration and overseas. Because of Nick, A4A is well-positioned to continue the mission to advance the airline industry and has a strong foundation on which his successor will build. We are very pleased that Nick will stay onboard to ensure a smooth transition.” Former A4A Board Chairman and Chairman and CEO of Airbus in North America Robin Hayes (former JetBlue CEO) applauded Calio’s leadership commenting: “Nick personally turned A4A into the premiere and most influential trade association in Washington, D.C. His deep, meaningful relationships with people he has known for years coupled with his deep knowledge and his ability to get things done are exemplary. And Nick never gives up. The reason why we have an airline industry at all today is because of Nick’s formidable determination, strategic thinking and bold leadership. Everyone working in an airline today should be incredibly grateful for Nick and his wonderful team who are real superstars.” Former A4A Board Chairman and former Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly said: “Nick has always known how to wrangle our board members—who are all competitors—and drive very meaningful discussions and reach pragmatic compromise on a range of issues over the years. His greatest talent and most valuable contribution may have been his ability to manage the various opinions, competing interests and a few egos along the way. His work with Harvard’s NPLI regarding the air quality safety in the cabin was absolutely superb and was instrumental in providing confidence in air travel at a critical time and was critical to restarting air travel after the pandemic.” Former A4A Board Chairman and former American Airlines CEO Doug Parker added: “Nick has done amazing things for our industry and for A4A. Under his leadership, we became a much stronger, more cohesive industry, and we became a stronger voice and a much more respected organization in D.C. That was especially apparent during the COVID pandemic when he led our effort to save hundreds of thousands of jobs, saved our industry and saved much of US Commerce during that time.” Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

This groundbreaking new tool measures the economic impact of destination marketing organization (DMO) websites on local economies, providing valuable data to optimize digital marketing strategies and improve visitor engagement. A Powerful New Tool for Destination Marketers The Website Impact Calculator (WIC) is a robust, user-friendly platform designed to enable DMOs to analyze and evaluate the influence of their online presence. By calculating the conversion of website visitors into actual travelers, the tool delivers key insights into how digital traffic contributes to local spending, job creation, and tax revenue generation in destinations. “Destination organizations are increasingly relying on digital platforms to promote their destination and attract visitors, but until now there has been limited understanding of how website traffic translates into tangible economic benefit,” said Don Welsh, President & CEO of Destinations International. “The Website Impact Calculator empowers destination organizations by providing the data they need to optimize marketing and promotion efforts, demonstrate value, and foster stronger relationships with local stakeholders.” Transforming Data from a Destination Organization’s Website into Actionable Insights The Website Impact Calculator utilizes proprietary data from Tourism Economics to provide insights that DMOs can use to measure the benefits of their owned media as well as optimize website content and the methods used to generate traffic. The tool quantifies website-driven visits and calculates influenced visitor spending—including lodging, dining, retail, transportation, and entertainment—based on localized economic impact modelling. It also measures job creation and tax revenue associated with DMO websites. “Today’s travelers are more likely than ever before to research destinations online before visiting.” “The Website Impact Calculator enables destination organizations to better understand how their websites attract visitors and drive local economic growth,” said Adam Sacks, President of Tourism Economics. “The WIC provides an essential connection between owned marketing investments and tangible outcomes.” Driving Tourism Growth through Data-Driven Decisions With the launch of the Website Impact Calculator, Destinations International and Tourism Economics set a new standard for data-driven decision-making in the tourism industry. Destination organizations can now utilize website traffic data to justify marketing budgets, attract new investments and optimize the impact of their online presence. The Website Impact Calculator leverages Tourism Economics’ Symphony Intelligence Platform – a comprehensive, interactive hub for data sources – and joins the Event Impact Calculator (EIC) , which is in use by more than 350 destination organizations worldwide and recognized as the global standard for measuring net new money coming to a community because of meetings and events.

Record 400 Million Pilgrims Attend Hindu Festival in India,https://eturbonews.com/record-400-million-pilgrims-attend-hindu-festival-in-india/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 13, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Kumbh Mela or Kumbha Mela, a major pilgrimage and festival in Hinduism, commenced in India today, marked by a ceremonial dip taken by tens of thousands of Hindus who seek to purify themselves of their sins. The Kumbh Mela festival, signifying the ‘great’ Kumbh, will run until February 26 in Prayagraj, a city located at the confluence of three rivers: the Ganges, Yamuna, and Saraswati, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Devotees performed their ritual bathing at 3:20 AM local time at Triveni Sangam, the sacred meeting point of the three rivers. In Hindu tradition, ‘Kumbh’ denotes a pot of nectar, while ‘Mela’ translates to a fair or gathering. It is believed that during a cosmic conflict between the gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras) over the nectar of immortality (Amrit), drops of this nectar fell at four significant locations in India: Haridwar, Prayagraj, Nashik, and Ujjain. These sites have since been deemed sacred, and the Kumbh Mela serves as a commemoration of this mythological event. The festival is traditionally credited to the 8th-century Hindu philosopher and saint Adi Shankara, as a part of his efforts to start major Hindu gatherings for philosophical discussions and debates along with Hindu monasteries across the Indian subcontinent. The adherents hold the belief that immersing oneself in the holy rivers during the Kumbh Mela cleanses the spirit, absolves sins, and bestows spiritual liberation. Although the Kumbh Mela is observed annually, the Maha Kumbh is regarded as the most significant, taking place once every twelve years in Prayagraj. Previously referred to as Allahabad, Prayagraj was renamed by the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, in 2018. This change was intended to acknowledge the city’s status as a spiritual hub for Hindu devotees. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited individuals from across the globe to participate in the festival, which was designated by UNESCO in 2017 as an “intangible cultural heritage of humanity.” This year, the event is anticipated to draw approximately 400 million devotees, setting an all-time record as the largest-ever gathering of humanity. With an such enormous anticipated attendance, security measures have been intensified, incorporating drones and AI-powered cameras, as reported by local media. Law enforcement and security organizations have utilized tethered drones and underwater drones for monitoring purposes. Thousands Flock to India Town for Lord Ram’s Temple Opening Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the construction of the temple a key part of his election campaign in 2019.

The importance of brands in Thailand are turning Bangkok into a global “playground city” while the shift in values of luxury travelers are at the heart of what is driving luxury forward, over 1,100 delegates (a record) heard at Thailand Tourism Forum (TTF) 2025 . Held at the InterContinental Bangkok, at the 14th TTF, the concept of JOMO (Joy of Missing Out) was unveiled, replacing FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) as peer-driven bucket list travel is overtaken by travelers wanting to disconnect as a form of self-care to pursue their own unique experiences. Spearheading the new luxury movement is a surging wellness sector worth THB 1.2 billion per year (USD 5.7 billion). This is measured next to a soaring branded residences sector worth THB 191 billion (USD 34.6 billion), which is just the beginning, said C9 Hotelworks Managing Director, Bill Barnett. “Wellness is no longer about spas, it’s about getting outside and enjoying a healthier lifestyle,” said Bill Barnett, the founder of TTF. “Guests are staying longer and spending habits are changing with the concept of longevity a potent force in the new luxury market.” The audience heard from hospitality data guru Jesper Palmqvist, STR’s regional vice president for Asia Pacific that destination is emerging as the key in Bangkok with luxury hotels performing best on the Chao Phraya River according to 2024 figures, playing into the “new luxury” narrative of nature and culinary-led neighborhoods being critical draw cards for high-end travelers.

Romania Joins US Visa Waiver Program,https://eturbonews.com/romania-joins-us-visa-waiver-program/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 10, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"The United States Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken announced today that Romania would become the 43rd country to be welcomed into US Visa Waiver Program (VWP) , which would enable Romanian nationals to enter the United States without a visa and remain for a duration of up to 90 days. Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Blinken express their appreciation to Romania for fulfilling the rigorous security criteria necessary for participation in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Romania stands out as a remarkable partner to the United States, and the strategic alliance between our nations has significantly strengthened in recent years. The inclusion of Romania in the VWP serves as a testament to our strategic collaboration and our mutual dedication to security and economic advancement. The VWP represents the culmination of extensive security collaborations between the United States and selected countries that adhere to stringent standards concerning counterterrorism, law enforcement, immigration enforcement, document security, and border management. Among the program’s stipulations is the requirement for a nonimmigrant visitor visa refusal rate of less than 3 percent in the preceding fiscal year; the issuance of secure travel documents; the provision of reciprocal travel rights to all US citizens and nationals, irrespective of national origin, religion, ethnicity, or gender; and active cooperation with US law enforcement and counterterrorism entities. Romania has made a considerable, coordinated governmental effort to satisfy all program criteria, which includes establishing partnerships with the United States to exchange information on terrorism and serious criminal activities with US law enforcement and security organizations, as well as enhancing its vetting processes for individuals traveling to and through Romania. As with all countries participating in the VWP, the Department of Homeland Security will consistently oversee Romania’s adherence to all program requirements and, as mandated by law, will conduct a thorough evaluation of Romania’s ongoing eligibility for the VWP based on the national security and law enforcement interests of the United States at least once every two years. The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) expects that the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) online and mobile applications will undergo updates around March 31, 2025. This enhancement will enable the majority of Romanian citizens and nationals to apply for travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) for tourism or business purposes for a duration of up to 90 days without the necessity of obtaining a US visa in advance. Generally, these authorizations are valid for a period of two years. Travelers holding valid B-1/B-2 visas may continue to utilize their visas for entry into the United States, and B-1/B-2 visas will still be available to Romanian citizens. ESTA applications can be accessed online or by downloading the “ESTA Mobile” application from the iOS App Store or Google Play store. US citizens currently benefit from visa-free travel to Romania, allowing them to stay for up to 90 days for tourism or business purposes, provided they possess a passport that remains valid for at least three months from their date of arrival. US Visa Waiver for Israel Visitors The United States of America has welcomed Israel as the 41st member of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP).

Reflecting on the success of last year’s festival in Newcastle, he added, “Our move to Hope Gardens isn’t just about expanding space; it’s about creating new opportunities for stakeholders, attracting more attendees, and showcasing the very best of Jamaica’s coffee culture.” Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining, the Hon.

This initiative guarantees authenticity and shares the stories of our farmers, their dedication, and their craftsmanship.” Minister of Investment, Industry, and Commerce, Senator the Hon. Aubyn Hill, emphasized the global significance of Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee. “This coffee is one of our nation’s finest treasures.” He added: “We must take pride in promoting it, celebrating it, and sharing it with the world. Congratulations to Minister Bartlett and his team for their unwavering commitment to showcasing our coffee heritage through this remarkable festival.” The festival has grown to become a cornerstone of Jamaica’s tourism and agricultural industries. It serves as a platform to connect coffee farmers, industry stakeholders, and local artisans with international markets while fostering economic growth in coffee-producing regions. This year’s event will showcase Jamaica’s vibrant coffee culture through an expanded marketplace featuring barista competitions, mixology demonstrations, and brewing workshops. Local chefs and food vendors will present coffee-infused dishes alongside authentic Jamaican gastronomy.

Jamaica Tourism on Track to Achieve Ambitious Growth,https://eturbonews.com/jamaica-tourism-on-track-to-achieve-ambitious-growth/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 10, 2025",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"“The 2024 end-of-year figures represent increases of 5.3% in visitor arrivals and 3.3% in earnings when compared to 2023 and were achieved despite challenges, including travel advisories, severe weather events and airlift restrictions over two quarters,” Minister Bartlett said. The 5x5x5 targets were previously set in 2016 and were on the verge of being achieved when the COVID-19 pandemic literally wiped-out global travel, forcing Jamaica and other tourist destinations to start all over from ground zero in rebuilding the industry. Addressing Sandals Resorts International’s 2025 Global Sales Meeting at its Sandals South Coast resort yesterday (January 9), Minister Bartlett underlined the importance of tourism to Jamaica and the wider Caribbean as he lauded Sandals as a leading contributor to the industry’s growth in the region. Describing it as a phenomenal home-grown multi-national corporation, Mr. Bartlett suggested to its executive chairman, Adam Stewart that the time had come for Sandals to spread its wings beyond the Caribbean and become a global brand. He suggested: “We need to go beyond the Caribbean now because the world is waiting for what you have given to the Caribbean, making it the most tourism-dependent region on planet Earth.” More than 50% of the Caribbean region’s gross domestic product (GDP) is predicated on tourism and one-in-four of all the workers are employed in the industry and, except for oil in Guyana, “tourism again stands out as the huge driver of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the region,” he pointed out. Similarly, locally, “when tourism grows, the economy grows; when tourism contracts, unfortunately the economy also contracts,” he noted. Having achieved “more in 24,” Minister Bartlett hailed the global Sandals sales force as dedicated professionals united by the purpose of strengthening and growing “the incredible Sandals brand that has become synonymous with Caribbean hospitality.” Underscoring that “Sandals is an integral part of our national identity,” he challenged them “to thrive for 25.” Visit Jamaica | The best music, food, vistas and vibes for your perfect vacation Discover the beauty of Jamaica with its fascinating culture, stunning beaches and lush landscapes.

Ascribing several attributes to Sandals, including its contribution to the Jamaica workforce and supporting farmers and other industries, Minister Bartlett affirmed that “this is what responsible tourism looks like, where success is measured not just in occupancy rates alone but by investing, and people are at the heart of the tourism industry.” In that regard, he assured that notwithstanding the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning and the wonderful things technology can do to change the way things are, “they are going to change it for people, and it is human intelligence that will give efficacy to the changes.” Mr. Bartlett argued that “the type of industry that will survive, whatever transition the world embraces, going forward, is going to be about people and tourism as the industry that is most related to people, will survive.” Jamaica’s Winter Tourism Season to Bring 1.6 Million Airline Seats to the Island Jamaica is experiencing an unprecedented surge in tourism as the winter season sees the destination securing 1.6 million airline seats, underscoring the island’s status as one of the Caribbean’s most sought-after destinations.

Do’s and Don’ts of Travel to Germany,https://eturbonews.com/dos-and-donts-of-travel-to-germany/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 10, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Traveling to any destination for a holiday can often be a source of stress, as there is much to consider and understand, depending on where you are headed. And Germany is no exception. Germany ranks as the eighth most-visited nation globally, attracting a total of 407.26 million overnight stays, which encompasses 68.83 million nights spent by international travelers. Furthermore, over 30% of German citizens choose to vacation within their own country. The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Reports indicate that Germany holds the third position out of 136 countries in the 2017 assessment, and it is recognized as one of the safest travel destinations in the world. Each year, Germany welcomes 30.4 million international tourists, generating more than US$38 billion in tourism revenue. The combined effects of domestic and international travel and tourism contribute directly over EUR 43.2 billion to the German economy. When considering indirect and induced effects, the sector accounts for 4.5% of the German GDP and sustains 2 million jobs, representing 4.8% of total employment. If you are planning a trip to Germany in 2025, here are some essential do’s and don’ts for visiting the land of bratwurst and BMW. Always carry cash While many nations have transitioned to cashless transactions, using physical currency remains prevalent in Germany. Numerous public restrooms require payment, and many establishments do not accept card payments, which is typically indicated by signage or communicated by staff. Nonetheless, in recent years, digital payment methods such as Apple Pay and Google Pay have gained popularity, so it is advisable to be prepared for both situations. Expect straightforward communication In Germany, directness in conversation is quite common. For instance, if someone offers you more food and you decline to be polite, they may interpret your response literally and not extend the offer again. Punctuality is of great importance in Germany While being a few minutes late may be tolerated, significant delays are generally unacceptable. If you anticipate being late, it is advisable to inform the individuals you are meeting at the earliest opportunity. Arriving late without a valid reason is regarded as impolite within German culture. Be attentive to dining etiquette There are specific customs to observe when eating and drinking in Germany. Resting your elbows on the table is considered impolite, as is hiding your hands from view. It is also courteous to wait for the host to say “Guten Appetit,” which is typically expressed by the person who prepared the meal, signaling that it is time to begin eating. Recognize the customs related to hand gestures In Germany, shaking hands is regarded as a polite form of greeting and may also occur during farewells. However, it is advisable to refrain from placing your hands in your pockets, as this is perceived as disrespectful. Always knock before entering a room Similar to other cultures, Germans expect individuals to knock on a closed door prior to entering. Failing to adhere to this practice is considered particularly discourteous in Germany. Acquaint yourself with fundamental German phrases Familiarizing yourself with essential German phrases such as greetings, farewells, polite expressions, and expressions of gratitude will significantly enhance your ability to communicate while in the country. It is important to recognize that not everyone may be proficient in English; therefore, initiating conversations in English without making an effort to use even basic German may lead to a less than warm reception. Utilize Germany’s public transportation system Germany offers a highly efficient and cost-effective public transportation network. Travelers can purchase tickets that permit access to trains, buses, and trams, making it easy to navigate the country. Tickets can typically be obtained from multilingual vending machines, and with advancements in technology, they are also available for purchase through smartphone applications and online platforms. Embrace the principles of reduce, reuse, recycle Germany is recognized for its commitment to environmental sustainability, and it has established a comprehensive waste separation system. Residents are expected to sort their waste, placing items such as glass and plastics into designated bins. Additionally, there is a strong cultural emphasis on reusing materials to minimize overall waste. Maintain a low volume in public spaces In contrast to certain other cultures, being loud in public settings is generally considered inappropriate in Germany. Engaging in activities such as speaking loudly on the phone is viewed as disrespectful. Germany sets new record for brand image Germany has once again been ranked no. 1 in the Anholt-Ipsos Nation Brands Index (NBI). 2022 is the sixth time in a row that Germany has topped the comparison Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

Total capacity, indicated by available seat kilometers (ASK), rose by 5.7% year-on-year. The load factor for November reached 83.4%, reflecting an increase of 1.9 percentage points from November 2023, marking a record high for the month. International demand experienced a significant rise of 11.6% compared to November 2023. Capacity grew by 8.6% year-on-year, with the load factor also at 83.4%, up by 2.3 percentage points from the previous year. This robust growth in demand was primarily driven by strong performances from carriers in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Domestic demand saw an increase of 3.1% relative to November 2023. Capacity rose by 1.5% year-on-year, and the load factor was recorded at 83.5%, which is an increase of 1.2 percentage points compared to November 2023. Domestic revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) experienced a 3.1% increase compared to the previous year, reflecting a slight deceleration from the 3.5% growth recorded in October. All markets exhibited signs of stable growth, with the exception of the United States, which experienced a 2.7% contraction, a decline more pronounced than the 1.2% year-on-year decrease noted in October. This contraction is part of a broader trend of slowing growth in the US domestic market since June 2024, primarily attributed to reduced activity from low-cost carriers. In contrast, mainline carriers in the US have continued to report growth during the same timeframe. All regions experienced growth in international passenger markets in November 2024 when compared to November 2023. Europe recorded the highest load factors at 85.0%, while the Asia-Pacific region led in growth, achieving a 19.9% year-on-year increase in demand. Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region reported a 19.9% year-on-year rise in demand, with capacity increasing by 16.2% and a load factor of 84.9%, reflecting an improvement of 2.6 percentage points compared to November 2023. European airlines experienced a 9.4% year-on-year growth in demand, with a capacity increase of 7.1%. The load factor stood at 85.0%, which is an increase of 1.8 percentage points from November 2023. Middle Eastern airlines noted an 8.7% year-on-year increase in demand, with capacity rising by 3.9%. The load factor reached 81.0%, marking an increase of 3.6 percentage points compared to November 2023. North American airlines recorded a 3.1% year-on-year increase in demand, with a capacity rise of 1.6%. The load factor was 81.0%, which is an increase of 1.1 percentage points from November 2023. Latin American airlines saw an 11.4% year-on-year increase in demand, with capacity climbing by 11.9%. The load factor was 84.4%, reflecting a decrease of 0.4 percentage points compared to November 2023. African airlines experienced a 12.4% year-on-year increase in demand, with capacity up by 6.0%. The load factor improved to 72.9%, an increase of 4.1 percentage points compared to November 2023. “November was another month of strong growth in the demand for air travel with an overall expansion of 8.1%. The month was also another reminder of the supply chain issues that are preventing airlines from getting the aircraft they need to meet growing demand. Capacity growth is lagging demand by 2.4 ppts and load factors are at record levels. Airlines are missing out on opportunities to better serve customers, modernize their products and improve their environmental performance because aircraft are not being delivered on time. The 2025 New Year’s resolution for the aerospace manufacturing sector must be finding a fast and durable solution for their supply chain issues,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. IATA: Record August Load Factor, Increased Passenger Demand The air travel market is thriving, and airlines are effectively responding to the increasing demand for travel.

Six Die in Temple Festival Stampede in Popular Indian Tourist Destination,https://eturbonews.com/six-die-in-temple-festival-stampede-in-popular-indian-tourist-destination/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 9, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"According to local news sources, 6 people lost their lives and approximately 40 others sustained injuries during a massive stampede at the Tirupati temple in India’s popular tourist destination, Andhra Pradesh . The disaster struck when a large numbers of Hindu devotees and visitors had assembled at the temple to participate in one of the principal festivals honoring Lord Vishnu, which consistently draws large crowds each year. Hundreds of devotees, holding the belief that witnessing the deity during this festival period confers spiritual advantages, have stormed to obtain tokens necessary for entering the temple and paying homage to Lord Vishnu, known as Lord Venkateshwara in Tirumala, ahead of the festival commencing tomorrow. According to the temple management, “comprehensive arrangements” had been established to handle large crowds during the ten-day festival. Conflicting reports from various media outlets have emerged regarding the precise cause of the deadly stampede. Some witnesses report that a woman in the queue experienced nausea, which led authorities to open the gates in an effort to expedite her transport to a hospital. The gate opening resulted in a sudden surge of the crowd, causing the ensuing chaos. Videos shared on social media depict police officers attempting to control the crowd as devotees and visitors pushed against one another amid the turmoil. Additional footage shows police administering CPR to injured devotees in the aftermath of the stampede. Temple management asserted that 91 counters were operational for the token distribution scheduled for mid-morning today. Nevertheless, a large number of devotees began to assemble well in advance in anticipation of obtaining tokens. The chairman of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) board attributed the situation to mismanagement and stated that measures had been implemented to mitigate traffic concerns in Tirupati. “Approximately 3,000 police officers, in addition to 1,550 TTD staff members, have been deployed for security measures,” he added. The TTD chief underscored that only those devotees possessing tokens would be allowed to join the queues, given the limited accommodation available in Tirumala, the location of the temple. According to the TTD officials, the average daily attendance at the temple is approximately 90,000 visitors. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences on X (formet Twitter) regarding the stampede, stating that the state government was extending “all possible assistance to those affected.” Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu, who is part of the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance currently in power at the national level, characterized the incident as “deeply disturbing.” The management of the temple has already faced significant scrutiny last year. In September, Chandrababu Naidu alleged that the sweets known as ‘laddus,’ primarily served to vegetarian devotees at the Sri Venkateswara temple, were tainted with animal fat. Following this, the Supreme Court of India criticized the Andhra Pradesh government for exacerbating a dispute without substantial evidence. 147 die in Indian festival stampede IDUKKI, India – A stampede of pilgrims returning from one of India’s most popular Hindu festivals killed 147 people and injured 55 others in southern India Friday night, police said.

Digital Nomads Are Changing the Tourism Industry A digital nomad visa is a type of work/stay authorization that enables individuals to engage in remote work while residing in a foreign nation for an extended period, surpassing the duration of a standard tourist visa. To be eligible for this visa, applicants must typically be employed by a company outside the host country or operate a business that can be effectively managed from a distance. The digital nomad visa may also provide advantageous tax arrangements for individuals who remain in a country long enough to establish it as their new tax residence. According to local news sources, the new visa scheme is part of a Taiwanese government initiative to attract digital professionals from around the world. Taiwan’s National Development Council (NDC) Minister Liu Ching-ching stated that, according to a UK-based consultancy Global Citizen Solutions report, the country has the highest number of digital nomads in Asia. He emphasized that Taiwan is known worldwide for its cuisine, good living conditions, and tourist attractions.

Pablo Escobar’s Boeing 727 Converted into British Airbnb,https://eturbonews.com/pablo-escobars-boeing-727-converted-into-british-airbnb/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","January 6, 2025",N/A,Harry Johnson,"A personal aircraft that once belonged to the infamous Colombian cocaine trafficker Pablo Escobar has been turned into an Airbnb guesthouse in the United Kingdom. The notorious Colombian drug lord known as the ‘king of cocaine’ for his role as the leader of the Medellin Cartel, dominated 80% of the global cocaine market at the peak of his power. He was killed at his residence in Colombia in 1993, although the precise details surrounding his death continue to be a subject of debate. Escobar’s Boeing 727’s fuselage, stripped of its wings and engines and re-named PYTCHAir, showcases a refurbished interior reminiscent of the 1980s. Former drug baron’s aircraft has been adorned with vibrant colors and artistic designs, features amenities such as a hot tub and sauna, and is operating from an industrial estate in Bristol. According to the plane’s current proprietor, the aircraft was originally manufactured 57 years ago, in 1968, converted for private ownership in 1981 and ultimately retired in 2012. The restoration of the aircraft was an endeavor that spanned several years, the current owner said, with the interior, which was initially installed in 1981, having been meticulously restored. Restored interior now features elegant walnut paneling, luxurious leather seating, and a shower and toilet finished in gold plating. Additionally, an outdoor shower is accompanied by a hot tub and a sauna. Re-named PYTCHAir, this unique Airbnb now offers the opportunity to “experience life as a billionaire at 32,” as stated in the Airbnb listing, providing guests with element of roleplay and cosplay, where they take pleasure in immersing themselves in that experience and indulging in a fantasy temporarily before going back to their everyday routines. The listing does not reference Pablo Escobar directly, and the plane’s previous registration in the Cayman Islands adds complexity to tracing its former owners. However, it is believed that one of its past owners may have been the infamous drug lord, according to the current aircraft owner. The least ezpensive overnight stay at the PYTCHAir is priced at £250 ($311), reaching up to £850 ($1,065) per night during the peak tourist season, with the revenue generated by the business slated to be reinvested in further restoration the jet and improvement of the overall guest experience, the owner said.

At Least 28 Killed In Jeju Air Fiery Crash in South Korea Boeing 737-800 passenger jets are the planes utilized predominantly by South Korean budget domestic carriers. Presently, Jeju Air possesses a fleet of 39 such aircraft. T’way Air, Jin Air, Eastar Jet, Air Incheon, and Korean Air collectively operate 62 of Boeing 737-800 planes. Acting President of South Korea, Choi Sang-mok, has mandated an urgent safety review of the nation’s entire airline operational framework to avert future aircraft incidents. “Even before the final results are out, we ask that officials transparently disclose the accident investigation process and promptly inform the bereaved families,” Choi said. South Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport’s examination of the national 737-800 fleet follows an incident involving a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 , which, while transporting 181 passengers from Bangkok, made a belly landing, veered off the runway, and subsequently exploded upon colliding with a wall at Muan International Airport, located approximately 180 miles southwest of Seoul. The investigation into the tragedy that resulted in the deaths of 179 out of 181 individuals on board, marking it as the most catastrophic airplane accident in South Korea’s history, is ongoing. Initial findings suggest that a malfunction in the landing gear may have been a contributing factor. Two crew members have survived the fiery crash and are currently receiving medical treatment for their injuries. Initial reports indicate that the tragedy resulted from a malfunction of the plane’s landing gear, which was triggered by a bird strike. The aircraft made an attempt to land but had to circle again before doing so. Observers noted flames shooting from the jet engine while the plane remained airborne. Aircraft’s pilots decided to land the aircraft on its fuselage; however, it could not decelerate sufficiently and collided with a building at the runway’s end, leading to an explosion and subsequent fire. Meanwhile, according to local media, another Boeing 737-800, operated by Jeju Air, had to return to a South Korean airport shortly after takeoff today, because of a recurring problem with its landing gear.

Travel industry experts have analyzed Google search data focusing on the most frequently searched terms related to “flights to,” selecting the top countries based on the average monthly search results. Research indicates that Japan ranks as the most sought-after destination for American travelers. The phrase “Flights to Japan” garners approximately 44,000 monthly searches, surpassing all other countries outside the United States. Japan is home to 26 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including notable locations such as Himeji Castle and the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto and Nara. Foreign visitors are particularly drawn to attractions such as Tokyo and Osaka, Mount Fuji, Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki. Additionally, popular activities include skiing at resorts like Niseko in Hokkaido, exploring Okinawa, experiencing the Shinkansen, and enjoying the extensive network of hotels and hot springs throughout the country. Italy follows in second place, emerging as the leading European destination for Americans. The term “Flights to Italy” averages around 26,000 searches each month. Italy has been a destination for travelers for centuries. Currently, the primary attractions for tourists in Italy include its rich culture, exquisite cuisine, historical significance, fashion, remarkable architecture, artistic heritage, religious landmarks and pilgrimage routes, stunning natural landscapes, vibrant nightlife, underwater attractions, and wellness spas. Both winter and summer tourism thrive in various regions of the Alps and the Apennines, while coastal tourism flourishes along the Mediterranean Sea.

In third position is Costa Rica, attracting 22,000 monthly searches for “Flights to Costa Rica,” making it the preferred Central American destination for American tourists. Since the late 1980s, Costa Rica has emerged as a prominent destination for nature tourism, primarily due to its extensive network of national parks and protected areas, which encompass approximately 23.4% of the nation’s land. This figure represents the highest percentage of protected land globally relative to a country’s total area. Despite occupying only 0.03% of the Earth’s landmass, Costa Rica is estimated to harbor 5% of the planet’s biodiversity, showcasing a remarkable array of flora and fauna.

The peak seasons for tourism generally occur in December and during the mid-summer months. Furthermore, there are notable increases in visitor numbers in the weeks leading up to Easter and Spring break, particularly attracting college students from the United States to favored beach resort destinations.

39 Killed in Azerbaijan Airlines Fiery Plane Crash in Kazakhstan,https://eturbonews.com/39-killed-in-azerbaijan-airlines-fiery-plane-crash-in-kazakhstan/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 25, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Russia-bound passenger plane, with sixty-two passengers and five crew members on board, crashed on Wednesday morning near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL) Embraer E190AR was traveling from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to Grozny in Russia’s Chechnya, when it declared an emergency while in flight over the Caspian Sea. The plane crash-landed approximately 3 kilometers (about 2 miles) from Aktau, located on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea. Official accounts indicate that dense fog in Grozny prevented the plane from landing there, necessitating a diversion to Makhachkala in Russia’s Dagestan. But according to some Russian sources, the aircraft might have altered its course in response to a possible aerial attack on Chechnya, with Grozny being targeted by several drones, leading the city airport to divert incoming flights. According to Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Emergency Situations, 25 people on board managed to survive the crash. 22 of 25 survivors have been admitted to local hospitals in critical condition. ‘There were 67 people on board the plane, including five crew members. The information about those injured is being clarified. According to preliminary data, there are 25 survivors. Twenty-two have been taken to a hospital,’ the ministry said in the official statement. The aircraft carried 37 citizens of Azerbaijan, 6 citizens of Kazakhstan, 3 citizens of Kyrgyzstan, and 16 citizens of Russia, Kazakh Ministry of Transport reported. Emergency response teams with over 150 first responders are actively working at the crash site, the ministry added. Initial inquiries suggest that the crash was caused by a bird strike. As reported by Kazakhstan’s Department of Health, an oxygen cylinder detonated on the aircraft following the bird strike, resulting in injuries to 14 individuals, among them two children, and leading to some passengers losing consciousness. The explosion is said to have taken place after a malfunction in the aircraft’s engine. Video recordings of the crash show the passenger jet descending rapidly before it struck the ground and burst in a massive fireball. The Federal Air Transport Agency of Russia (Rosaviatsia) has released the following statement regarding the incident: ”Today, at about 09:30 Moscow time, near the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea, while approaching Aktau Airport in Kazakhstan, an Embraer 190 aircraft of the Azerbaijani airline AZAL collided with the ground. Preliminary information suggests that the aircraft commander declared an emergency following a bird strike and diverted to Aktau as a backup airfield. Emergency services in Kazakhstan are conducting search and rescue operations. Rosaviatsia is in contact with AZAL, and aviation authorities in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.” The hydraulic system was almost destroyed in a missile attack, aviation experts say. Pilots tried to use a manual backup to compensate for the hydraulic system destroyed. The front part of the plane touched the ground first, killing everyone in the front of the aircraft, and due to this heroic action by the pilots, many lives of passengers in the back of the aircraft were saved. The pilot found a fairly open and flat terrain to land this aircraft. It also saved the lives of many on the ground.

All Americans Told to Leave Belarus Immediately,https://eturbonews.com/all-americans-told-to-leave-belarus-immediately/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 24, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"The United States Department of State has issued a strongly worded advisory warning US citizens against all travel to Belarus, an urging all Americans currently in the country to leave as soon as possible. The State Department has advised American citizens against traveling to Belarus, citing the local government’s “arbitrary enforcement of local laws and the risk of detention,” inadequate detention conditions, the possibility of abrupt border closures, as well as the “potential for civil unrest.” Washington’s official advisory also stated, “US citizens in Belarus should depart immediately.” In 2020, the United States imposed sanctions on Belarus due to the electoral misconduct. American embassy and all consulates in Belarus have been shut down following the onset of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Americans warned not to travel to Belarus In its latest advisory, US State Department warned about the “increased volatility and unpredictable nature of the regional security situation,” due to Belarus’ support for Russia in its ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine. The advisory urged Americans to reconsider using electronic devices in Belarus, emphasizing that all communications within the country are likely to be monitored by Belarusian security services. It warned that foreign nationals have been detained based on data retrieved from their phones or computers, which was created, transmitted, or stored outside of Belarus. If US citizens choose to travel to Belarus despite the official warnings, they should not use social media and log out of all accounts, State Department said. Americans were also warned to steer clear of any public demonstrations or protests, since participation in them could lead to arrest or detention, with limited access to diplomatic support. Full text of the United States Department of State’s Belarus Travel Advisory: “Reissued after periodic review without changes to Level 4: Do Not Travel status. Do not travel to Belarus due to the Belarusian authorities’ arbitrary enforcement of local laws, the risk of detention, the continued facilitation of Russia’s war against Ukraine, the potential of civil unrest, and the Embassy’s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens residing in or traveling to Belarus. U.S. citizens in Belarus should depart immediately. On February 28, 2022, the Department of State ordered the departure of U.S. government employees and the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Minsk. All consular services, routine and emergency, are suspended until further notice. U.S. citizens in Belarus who require consular services should try to leave the country as soon as possible and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country. Belarus does not recognize dual nationality. Belarusian authorities may refuse to acknowledge dual U.S.-Belarusian nationals’ U.S. citizenship, and may deny or delay U.S. consular assistance to detained dual nationals. Due to Belarusian authorities’ arbitrary enforcement of local laws and the risk of detention, continued facilitation of Russia’s war against Ukraine, and the heightened volatility and unpredictable nature of the regional security environment, do not travel to Belarus. U.S. citizens are advised to avoid public demonstrations. Authorities have used force to disperse demonstrators, including those peacefully demonstrating. Bystanders, including foreign nationals, may face the possibility of arrest or detention. Reconsider bringing electronic devices into Belarus. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Belarus are monitored by Belarusian security services. Belarusian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices, including information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country. U.S. citizens should regularly reevaluate possible departure plans in the event of an emergency. Border crossings with neighboring states are sometimes closed with little notice. Additional closures of crossing points along Belarus’ borders with Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, and Ukraine are possible. Country Summary: Belarusian authorities have detained tens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens and other foreign citizens, for alleged affiliations with opposition parties and alleged participation in political demonstrations, even if there is evidence this affiliation took place outside of Belarus. Approximately 1,300 prisoners are currently jailed for politically-related acts that may not be considered crimes in the United States. The Belarusian government has denied prisoners access to their Embassy and lawyers, restricted communication with family outside prisons, and limited access to information. Conditions in Belarusian detention facilities are extremely poor. U.S. citizens in the vicinity of demonstrations have been arrested. Some have been victims of harassment and/or mistreatment by Belarusian officials. Belarusian officials unevenly enforce laws and regulations. Belarusian authorities have targeted individuals associated with independent and foreign media. On May 23, 2021, Belarusian authorities forced the landing of a commercial aircraft transiting Belarusian airspace in order to arrest an opposition journalist who was a passenger. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an Advisory Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. air carriers and commercial operators, U.S. pilots, and U.S. registered aircraft from operating at all altitudes in the Minsk Flight Information Region (UMMV) subject to limited exceptions.” Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

The proposed amendments eliminate grey zones and ambiguity about when passengers are owed compensation, which will ensure quicker resolutions for passengers. “The government welcomes the participation of passengers, airlines, airports, civil society and all Canadians in the public consultation. After this consultation, the final regulations will be published in the Canada Gazette, Part II. “We will work to reach the right balance between protecting the rights of passengers and promoting a competitive air sector. Together, I am confident we will find that balance.” Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel
Hold My Drink: Airlines Vie to Rival United Healthcare Greed,https://eturbonews.com/hold-my-drink-airlines-vie-to-rival-united-healthcare-greed/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 20, 2024",N/A,Dr. Anton Anderssen - special to eTN,"Representing their respective airlines were Robert Schroeter, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer of Frontier Airlines, and Matthew Klein, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer of Spirit Airlines. Both executives faced intense questioning over policies that incentivize employees to charge passengers for carry-on baggage deemed too large, often in ways that catch travelers off-guard at the gate. Hawley, visibly frustrated, pointed out that the two airlines had paid their employees a combined $26 million in bounty in 2022 and 2023 for enforcing strict baggage policies. These bonuses, he argued, effectively encourage airline staff to prioritize extracting additional fees from passengers rather than fostering a pleasant travel experience. “You’re paying your employees to police bags rather than serve customers. That’s not service; it’s a shakedown,” Hawley said. “Flying on your airlines is horrible. It’s a terrible experience, and this is why.” Adding insult to injury, Schroeter and Klein both earn hefty salaries—Schroeter rakes in an estimated $2.4 million annually, while Klein’s compensation exceeds $2.8 million. Hawley’s critique took on an even sharper edge in light of these figures, highlighting the glaring disparity between executive pay and the everyday passenger’s travel experience. “It seems the only thing your companies are transparent about is how well you’re lining your own pockets while nickel-and-diming the public,” Hawley remarked. Greed Over Service The hearing laid bare a stark contrast between the airlines’ claims of offering affordable travel options and the reality faced by passengers, who often encounter surprise fees at the gate. Frontier and Spirit, two airlines notorious for their “no-frills” approach, justify these charges as part of their business model, which purportedly allows them to offer low base fares. However, the practice of rewarding employees for enforcing these fees paints a troubling picture of an industry more concerned with squeezing profits than ensuring fairness. “It’s not enough that passengers pay for their ticket,” Hawley continued. “Now, they’re being nickel-and-dimed for carrying a bag that might be an inch too big. And worse, your airlines have turned gate agents into bounty hunters.” “This isn’t about safety or efficiency—it’s about greed.” Adding fuel to the fire, Air Canada announced this week that it would begin charging passengers for larger carry-on bags if they opt for the lowest-priced fare on North American and Caribbean routes, starting January 3, 2025 . This move is seen by many as an audacious attempt to match the greed and appalling behavior exhibited by U.S. airlines. It’s as if Air Canada looked at the disgraceful practices being exposed in the U.S. Senate and said, “Hold my drink.” Indeed, airlines now seem to be taking cues from the likes of United Healthcare, another industry infamous for squeezing profits at the expense of everyday consumers. Unfair to Passengers The senator’s critique resonates with many travelers who have experienced the stress and humiliation of being forced to pay exorbitant fees moments before boarding a flight. These practices disproportionately affect budget-conscious passengers, who often choose low-cost carriers precisely because of their advertised affordability. Hawley argued that the airlines’ tactics betray a lack of integrity, undermining consumer trust. “You’re targeting people who can least afford these fees,” Hawley said. “Families, students, seniors on fixed incomes—they’re the ones who bear the brunt of this. And your solution is to pat yourselves on the back and hand out bonuses to the employees who enforce it? It’s disgraceful.” Air Canada’s new policy further illustrates the insidious trend of airlines exploiting passengers under the guise of “transparency.” Instead of addressing concerns raised by lawmakers and passengers alike, the industry appears to be doubling down on its greed. Such moves erode trust and make air travel an increasingly hostile experience for the average traveler. The Call for Accountability The hearing underscores growing bipartisan concern about the airline industry’s fee structures, with lawmakers increasingly calling for regulatory measures to protect consumers. Hawley’s sharp questioning reflects broader frustrations with an industry that, despite receiving significant taxpayer support during the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to implement policies perceived as exploitative. As the investigation continues, there is mounting pressure for airlines to reevaluate their fee practices and prioritize transparency and fairness over profit margins. Hawley’s fiery rhetoric serves as a reminder that unchecked corporate greed will not go unnoticed—and that the fight for consumer rights is far from over.

Towards BIT 2025: Challenges and Opportunities for an Evolving Tourism Industry,https://eturbonews.com/towards-bit-2025-challenges-and-opportunities-for-an-evolving-tourism-industry/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 20, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"The festive season is always an important test for the travel industry. And, with the start of the countdown to BIT 2025, on at fieramilano – Rho from 9 to 11 February 2025 , the exhibition organized by Fiera Milano, leader in Italy for innovation in tourism, the BIT Observatory has analyzed the most interesting data and trends. Italians book early and revenues are on the up Regarding holiday travel, data from ASTOI – a partner of BIT 2025 – confirms that the trend toward early booking is growing stronger: 60% of bookings for holidays between December 18, 2024 and January 12, 2025 were made at least 90 days in advance . A factor that contributed to a 12% increase in revenue compared to 2023: the average price of the packages is around 2,400 euros per person and the average duration is 8.2 days . Experiences, well-being and hyper-personalization But what does the global scenario look like, and what can we expect next year to bring? In 2023, global tourism recovered approximately 90% of its 2019 levels and in 2024 a further increase of 2% is recorded: 21% of the world’s population travels, a figure that will rise to 24% in 2030 and 33% by 2040 ( Source: Oxford Economics ). Of the countries that generate tourism, China, Germany, the UK and the USA stand out, these alone accounting for 45% of global flows, while the emerging markets include Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico and Pakistan . When it comes to destinations, Spain, France and the USA will remain in poll position, while Italy will rank sixth in 2040. Overall, the top five destinations will reduce their share of global tourism from 30% to 20% : a sign that travelers are looking for something new and that destinations will become more diversified ( Source: Oxford Economics ). A driver of economic growth that promotes cultural exchange and mutual understanding From the meta-analysis carried out by the BIT Observatory, it emerges that the multiplier effects of tourism involve numerous productive, cultural and social sectors, promoting exchanges of experiences and “cultural osmosis” which favour the overall socio-economic growth . In fact, tourists favor local culture, traditions and cuisine which, together with well-being and active and outdoor holidays , account for over two thirds of global demand ( Source: Deloitte ). The focus on experiences and the demand for increasingly personalized offers are confirmed. The BIT Observatory also notes that to continue maintaining this sustained and sustainable growth in the coming years too, decision makers will have to pay close attention to the growing pressure on the most iconic destinations . The analysis suggests that, despite the diversification underway, the largest flows will continue to be concentrated in four main macro-regions: the Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and the Caribbean . To address these challenges, it will be essential to use the opportunities offered by technological innovation, and in particular by digitalization , for example by facilitating the organization and personalization of travel, pushing towards more inclusive and hybrid modes . BIT 2025: the event where you can get an exclusive sneak preview of tomorrow’s travel BIT 2025 responds to these themes and challenges with the continuous evolution of its exhibition format , featuring a new location at fieramilano – Rho : the areas dedicated to Leisure, Italy and World will benefit from a more streamlined layout and smoother access, especially on the day open to the public on Sunday 9 February. In the Italy area, all the Italian holiday regions from North to South will be represented: from Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Veneto , to Abruzzo, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania , from Emilia-Romagna and Marche to Sicily . Among the foreign destinations, the grand comebacks of Visit USA, Cuba, Japan, the Dominican Republic and Vietnam stand out, but also Mediterranean destinations such as Algeria, the Canary Islands, Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia , or emerging destinations such as Central America and Uruguay . As far as the operators in attendance go, these will include Blu Hotels, BWH Hotel Group, Mangia’s Resorts and Clubs and The Social Hub in the hospitality sector and Gattinoni among the tour operators. Among the cruise operators, MSC, Grimaldi and Giver stand out, while many carriers will be present, such as ANA, Eva Airways, ITA Airways, Singapore Airlines among the airlines and Trenord among the railway operators. This year, the spotlight will also be on the theme of digital and innovative services , with companies such as Blastness, Compass-HeyLight, Revolut and Titanka! in attendance. Finally, the partnerships with associations and networks are a key element of the exhibition. These will include ASTOI, ETOA – European Tour Operators Association Limited, FTO – Italian Federation of Organized Tourism, Federterme and WTG – Welcome Travel Group . After the success of the first edition last year, Thermalia by Federterme is also returning to BIT 2025 , a real holiday resort dedicated to spa, medical and wellness tourism which will also offer a rich program of events: among these, meetings with institutions and experts, new lifestyle proposals, insights into new techniques. There will also be a new hospitality area and events with a high social media potential to engage younger travelers and Gen Z in particular. As usual, the conference program of Bringing Innovation into Travel is also very rich. Just to give a few examples, the role of continuing education in the industry will be discussed, with a focus on the digital sphere and the customer experience , also in response to the increasing demand for qualified personnel . The spotlight will also shine on next-generation technologies such as AI, with its impact on personalizing the journey, optimizing operations and improving customer interaction. Sustainability and emotion-driven tourism will also be in the foreground, the former meeting the need to spread good practices and the latter stemming from the growing awareness of travelers. Macro-themes spanning from aviation, luxury, and travel risk management to the scouting of new destinations to prepare the tourism product of the future will also be on the agenda. Finally, these will be a strong focus on professional opportunities with Bit4job , a recruiting day that will be held on Tuesday 11 February in pavilion 11 . A packed program of events will encourage meetings between students from tourism, hotel and related institutes , and from post-diploma university and ITS (higher technical institute) programs with study courses dedicated to tourism, featuring the participation of professionals and companies from the travel industry . BIT 2025 will be held at fieramilano – Rho from 9 to 11 February 2025. BIT 9 will only be open to trade operators on Monday 11 and Tuesday 11 February , and on Sunday 10 February it will also be open to the public.

We continue to invest in our fleet in line with our growth targets in Turkey and globally, and to expand our network by launching new routes. Currently, with an average age of 4.5 years, we have the youngest fleet in Turkey and rank among the airlines with the youngest fleets in the world. Within the scope of our agreement with Boeing, we have ordered a total of 200 Boeing 737-10 aircraft. The first 100 aircraft, for which we have placed firm orders, will begin joining our fleet starting in 2028. We will evaluate converting the remaining 100 aircraft options into firm orders in the coming years, based on market conditions and the needs of our fleet. Boeing aircraft have been an integral part of our operations since Pegasus entered the aviation industry in 1990. We are pleased to be expanding our fleet with the new Boeing 737-10 model aircraft. We are confident that our collaboration will create new opportunities for local manufacturing, technology transfer, R&D, training, and employment in the Turkish aviation industry. When considered within the scope of Boeing’s National Aerospace Initiative launched with the Turkish government in 2017, our order will also open new doors and create production and export opportunities both for Turkish manufacturers and for the wider aviation industry.” Pegasus Airlines Receives Credit Rating Upgrade Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

The accident happened around 4pm when the navy speedboat, which was manned by a crew of five, lost control during engine trials and struck the privately operated ferry, which was transporting over one hundred passengers. Authorities have reported that at least 13 fatalities resulted from this tragic event. One dead, dozens missing in two-ferry disaster in India The Neelkamal, a privately owned ferry, capsized and sank while transporting around 110 people to the Elephanta Caves , a renowned tourist attraction and UNESCO World Heritage Site that dates back to the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Video footage shared online captures the speedboat maneuvering erratically before it collided with the ferry at high speed. According to local media, rescue operations were launched immediately with 11 Navy vessels, three Marine Police boats, a Coast Guard ship, and four helicopters deployed. Civilian personnel – the police, the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority, and local fishermen, also contributed to the search and rescue initiatives. A total of 101 people had been rescued from the water, with four of the victims reported to be in critical condition and hospitalized, according to Maharashtra state Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. In the official statement, Indian Navy “regretted” the “tragic loss” of life, stating that its speedboat “lost control while conducting engine trials in Mumbai Harbor due to an engine malfunction. Consequently, the boat collided with a passenger ferry, which then capsized.” India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, extended his sympathies to the families affected by the tragedy. In a message posted on X, he stated, “I hope for a swift recovery for those injured,” while also declaring an ex-gratia payment of 200,000 rupees ($2,350) for the relatives of each deceased individual and 50,000 rupees for those who were injured.

Eleven Indians Die at Gudauri Ski Resort in Georgia,https://eturbonews.com/eleven-indians-die-at-gudauri-ski-resort-in-georgia/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 18, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"According to Indian mission officials in Georgia, eleven Indian nationals who were employed at Georgia’s largest ski resort, have been found dead with local authorities investigating whether carbon monoxide poisoning could have been the cause of these fatalities. Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs stated that local police discovered the bodies of twelve restaurant employees – eleven Indian nationals and one Georgian citizen, with no signs of life, in their bedrooms on the second floor of the Indian restaurant Haveli, located at the Gudauri ski resort . The official statement indicates that preliminary findings from the investigation suggest restaurant’s electric power generator was located in a confined space adjacent to the sleeping areas. This generator was activated due to a power outage, which likely resulted in the emission of carbon monoxide into the rooms, leading to the asphyxiation of the workers during their sleep. The Georgian police have initiated a criminal inquiry into potential negligent manslaughter. Investigative measures are currently in progress concerning the incident; forensic specialists are present at the scene, and interviews with individuals associated with the case are being conducted. Necessary expert evaluations have been arranged, according to officials. According to Georgia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, preliminary assessments indicated a lack of evidence for violence or injuries. The Indian mission in Georgia’s capital Tbilisi has expressed its condolences to the families of the victims and emphasized its collaboration with local authorities to ensure the swift repatriation of the remains. Carbon monoxide, commonly known as a ‘silent killer’, is an odorless gas generated by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels. Its inhalation can impair the blood’s capacity to transport oxygen throughout the body. Typical symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning encompass headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, chest pain, and confusion; however, individuals may fall victim to its effects during sleep without displaying any noticeable symptoms. Gudauri is a large ski resort located about 120 km (75 mi) to the north of the Georgian capital Tbilisi, on the south-facing plateau of The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range in Georgia. The resort is situated in the Kazbegi Municipality, along the Georgian Military Highway near the Jvari Pass, at an elevation of 2,200 meters (7,200 ft.) above sea level. The ski season lasts from December to April.

Visa-Free Visitors Not Affected by New Thai E-Visa Rule,https://eturbonews.com/visa-free-visitors-not-affected-by-new-thai-e-visa-rule/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 18, 2024",N/A,Imtiaz Muqbil,"Citizens from 93 countries who are eligible for visa-free entry to Thailand will be able to travel as usual without the need to apply for the online E-Visa, which is set to be implemented on January 1, 2025. This new initiative is specifically designed for individuals traveling for non-tourism reasons from the 93 eligible countries, as well as for citizens of nations that require visas, regardless of the purpose of their visit. In summary, this is not a universally applicable Electronic Travel Authorization scheme. Clarification on this matter required three inquiries during the E-Visa announcement briefing conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 17. In essence, Thailand will maintain unrestricted access for visitors from countries that account for approximately 90% of the kingdom’s tourist arrivals, thereby supporting the tourism objectives and strategies established for 2025. The primary alteration is that individuals who require visas, based on their nationality or the purpose of their visit, will no longer be obligated to submit a physical application at any of Thailand’s 94 embassies and consulates globally. This process can now be completed online, at any time and from any location. Provided that the system operates without any technological or bureaucratic issues, it will significantly simplify the visa application process for citizens of neighboring countries with substantial upper and middle-class populations, such as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Additionally, it will facilitate access for residents in nations and secondary cities lacking a Thai diplomatic presence, thereby potentially creating new avenues for visitor arrivals. The e-visa website is accessible in 15 languages, with a projected processing time of four to five working days. Applicants will also have the ability to track their visa application online. It is important to note that the visa fee is non-refundable, even in cases where the application is rejected. Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa and Mr. Worawoot Pongprapapant, Director-General of the Department of Consular Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, emphasized in their addresses that the E-Visa initiative aims to uphold Thailand’s status as a premier travel destination by enhancing accessibility amid intense competition for tourist expenditures. They provided assurances regarding the security and safety of the system. Mr. Maris stated, “We recognize that in a competitive global environment, the ease of travel is a crucial element in attracting international visitors, whether they are tourists, business travelers, students, digital nomads, or investors.” He further remarked, “Central to Thai foreign policy is a dedication to fostering relationships with the international community, engaging not only with governments but also with the populace.” The E-Visa system has been under development since February 2019, initially launched in Beijing exclusively for the Chinese market. It was subsequently broadened in September 2021 and is now set to be implemented globally. Several inquiries were raised during the discussions. The first two questions, posed by a Russian journalist and the Brazilian Ambassador, sought clarification regarding visa-free access for their nationals. The Ambassador highlighted that without visa-free access for Brazilians to Thailand, Brazil might need to impose reciprocal measures against Thai citizens. A third question from a Pakistani diplomat inquired about the process for visa fee payments. The fourth question, raised by the head of the Airline Operators Committee at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport, concerned how check-in personnel at various airline counters worldwide would verify the issuance of visas. The proposed scheme appears promising at first glance. The E-Visa website makes a significant effort to clarify the process through both PDF manuals and video tutorials. Nonetheless, it is likely to encounter challenges during this initial implementation phase, which is typical for many online systems. A detailed examination of the website reveals intricate documentation requirements that must be verified to prevent fraud and forgery. Additionally, this editor was unable to locate a helpline for individuals seeking further assistance. Inevitably, a new network of intermediary websites and agents will arise to assist applicants with the process, albeit for a fee. Ultimately, the influx of tourists to Thailand from the 93 visa-exempt countries is expected to remain uninterrupted. Furthermore, new customer segments from emerging markets, particularly in Africa, may also be tapped. While a small percentage of applicants may experience technical or bureaucratic issues, these challenges are likely to be resolved over time.

The government anticipates that the investment required for stadium construction and upgrades could reach as much as 5 billion dirhams (approximately $500 million). According to Morocco’s Minister of Tourism, the country has recorded a 20% increase in tourist arrivals compared to the previous year, with data from the Ministry of Tourism revealing that Morocco welcomed 15.9 million tourists during the first eleven months of the year. In addition to enhancing airport capacity, Morocco plans to extend its high-speed rail line to Marrakech prior to the World Cup, with future plans to extend it further south to Agadir.

Describing workers as “the backbone of the industry,” he pointed out that “tourism is about service and 60 percent of the value of the experience of the visitor to the destination is service, not service provided by machines but by human beings, you the workers.” Reminding that the service delivery begins at the airport, Minister Bartlett told the various categories of airport workers: “You represent the moment of truth in marketing – when the customer meets the product for the first time.” “So when they land on the tarmac here and they step out and breathe the air that is fresh and nice, that’s where the service begins.” He also pointed out that Jamaica was far ahead in using technology to enable seamlessness in arrivals for visitors and issued an appeal for travellers, including Jamaicans, to fill in their immigration information online beforehand to avoid delays at Immigration and Customs. Minister Bartlett implored the tourism workers to “let us make this winter season the best, because already it is shaping up to be. We have 178,000 more new seats this winter than any other winter season in our history; that means we have 1.45 million seats coming from across the world for the winter if 80 percent load factor is realized.” The Minister highlighted that “at 100 percent load factor take up, arrivals will be at a record 1.6 million seats.” Montego Bay Chapter Chair of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association (JHTA), Kerry-Ann Quallo-Casserly also extended appreciation to all the dedicated airport workers, noting that “your tireless effort to ensure the smooth operation of our airport, coupled with your warm hospitality and welcoming smile make a lasting impression on all visitors.” Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer of MBJ Airports, operators of SIA, Shane Munroe underscored that “Sangster International Airport is not just a gateway; it’s a place where first and last impressions of Jamaica are made, and you our airport staff ensure that those memories are unforgettable.” He added, “you are the heartbeat of the operation here at MBJ and the faces of Jamaica to the word, and the reason for our success.” Also lauding the workers, Mayor of Montego Bay, Councillor Richard Vernon likened them to the Internet experience with the airport representing connectivity in the physical space. “That connectivity creates an experience for those who visit and you are responsible for putting together that experience upon entrance and upon exit,” he said. The annual breakfast served as an awards ceremony, with the JTB recognizing several workers from the various service departments at the airport for their outstanding contribution to the tourism industry. Topping the list of awardees by claiming “The Chairman’s Award” was Natari Dixon who was lauded as “an individual whose dedication and unwavering support has left an indelible mark on JTB and by extension, Jamaica.” The award was presented by Minister Bartlett.

This decision is a response to the increasing incidents of anti-Semitism lately observed in the Alpine country. The Intercommunity Coordination against Antisemitism and Defamation (CICAD) reported that it had documented 944 incidents of anti-Semitism in the French-speaking region of Switzerland in 2023, marking a 68% increase from the prior year. Switzerland refuses to ban swastika, other Nazi symbols According to the official statement of the Swiss Federal Council , the proposed legislation seeks to address a legal gap that currently permits individuals to display such symbols, provided they do not actively advocate for the ideologies they represent. The ban will specifically focus on prominent symbols associated with Adolf Hitler’s National Socialist regime, including modified modern representations such as the numeric codes ’18’ and ’88.’ Swiss federal government emphasized that the context of these displays will be critical in assessing their legality. Certain exceptions to the ban have been established for educational, scientific, artistic, or journalistic purposes, thereby allowing the display of these prohibited symbols, images, and gestures under the rights of freedom of expression. Additionally, existing religious symbols that may resemble those of the Third Reich will remain unaffected by this legislation. Those who defy the new law will incur penalties amounting to 200 Swiss Francs ($224 or 213 euros). The Federal Council said in its statement that “Racism and anti-Semitism are intolerable in a democratic and free society.” The details of the proposed ban will be discussed by the government officials until March 31, 2025. The proposed new law is the result of a parliamentary request, and is designed to be potentially applicable to other extremist, racist, and violence-glorifying symbols in a subsequent phase.

By conducting these flights, Ethiopian Airlines breached the terms of its operating authority and engaged in air transportation without the necessary DOT authorization. An independent investigation by the OACP uncovered that from August 2022 to September 2022, Etihad Airways conducted multiple flights utilizing the JetBlue Airways code between the United Arab Emirates and the United States, within airspace that the FAA has designated as prohibited for U.S. operators. Furthermore, despite OACP informing Etihad Airways of these violations in September 2022 and November 2022, it was discovered that between January 2023 and April 2023, Etihad Airways continued to operate several additional flights under the JetBlue Airways code in the same restricted airspace. This conduct constituted a breach of the terms of its operating authority and involved air transportation activities without the requisite DOT authorization.

Bleisure Travel: Reward or Cheating?,https://eturbonews.com/bleisure-travel-reward-or-cheating/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 13, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"But are we truly taking advantage of what seems to be a logical idea of mixing play time with work and killing two birds with one stone, or are we merely killing the whole idea of taking time off from work to enjoy a holiday in its entirety the way it was originally intended? Let’s look at the possible pros and cons. Breaking Down Bleisure Travel The idea of bleisure travel is that technically you are going on a business trip, and since you’re traveling anyway and airfare will already be paid, why not add on a couple days or so to enjoy some fun time? The destination location is going to play a big part in this bleisure contemplation. If one has never been to the travel destination, the inclination is to do some exploring, especially if it’s some exotic place one has dreamed about visiting. Honestly, would you go to a business conference in Rome, Italy, and not want to spend some time tooling around the city? Who’s Driving the Bleisure Trend? It may be no surprise that the Gen Z professionals and Millenials are the largest drivers of bleisure travel. They have a tendency to value the balance of work and personal life and see this as a wonderful opportunity to apply just that. But What Does the Boss Say? In our modern world, more higher ups are inclined to allow employees to combine business with pleasure and see it as a perk they can offer to not only attract talent but to keep them as well. As long as the employee and company are willing to separate out the costs, this could be seen as a win-win employee benefit. The Trend is Not so New Those in the travel and tourism industry already know that attending a conference is likely rounded off with at least a day at the end of business to enjoy and experience the destination itself with opportunities to sign up for activities already planned for. And even if that option is not available, the boss says it’s okay to tack on some fun time after the work time, so what are you waiting for? ‘Bleisure’ travel is on the rise Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

These new roles are intended to capitalize on the robust increase in visits and expenditures from the US to the UK, fostering relationships and aligning travel trade initiatives with targeted communications to ensure that Britain remains a prominent choice for American travelers. VisitBritain Names New Senior Vice President for the USA As the Vice President of Travel Trade and the Aviation Industry, Yau will enhance and develop VisitBritain’s partnerships with prominent US travel trade and airline entities. His efforts will focus on broadening the availability of British products within the US market, assisting airlines with the launch of new routes, and promoting the regional destinations they service.

Bulgaria and Romania Join Passport-Free Open-Border Schengen Area,https://eturbonews.com/bulgaria-and-romania-join-passport-free-open-border-schengen-area/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 12, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"The European Council (EC), a collegiate body that defines the overall political direction and priorities of the European Union (EU), announced today that it will remove all land border controls with Bulgaria and Romania in January of next year, thereby granting these two countries full membership in the Schengen free travel area. Established in 1985, the Schengen area (also known as Schengen zone) is the largest internal border-free area in the world controls. It consists of 29 members, which include 25 of the 27 European Union member states, along with Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. Europe Travel Gets Pricier With New Schengen Visa Fee Hike Bulgaria and Romania’s admission into passport-free open-border Schengen area, which has been postponed due to apprehensions regarding illegal immigration, arrives almost two decades since the two Eastern European countries became fully-fledged members of the European Union. The two nations, both members of NATO, became part of the European Union in 2007. However, their entry into the Schengen area was delayed due to the need to address various concerns, including issues related to corruption. This process was further stalled during the European refugee crisis in 2015. In 2022, Austria obstructed the efforts of Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen area, citing the influx of refugees arriving through the Western Balkans as a primary concern. According to Reuters, these two Balkan countries serve as significant transit points for the illegal trafficking of arms, drugs, and humans. In March, Austria consented to the partial inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the Schengen zone, lifting checks at air and maritime borders, while maintaining restrictions on land borders. Austria’s Interior Minister, Gerhard Karner, stated in November that Vienna had made considerable advancements in border security, resulting in a substantial decrease in the number of illegal migrants arriving via Romania and Bulgaria. The European Council concluded on December 10 that both countries fulfill the essential criteria for complete accession to the Schengen Area. In today’s statement, which characterized this admission as a “historic moment,” the European Council announced that all land border control posts between Bulgaria and other Schengen nations, as well as between Bulgaria and Greece, and Romania and Hungary, will be scrapped on January 1, 2025. According to the current Hungarian presidency of the European Union, the admission of Bulgaria and Romania into Schengen zone will be advantageous not only for the citizens of both countries, but also for the bloc as a whole. Upon learning of European Council’s decision, the Prime Minister of Romania, Marcel Ciolacu, said that since Schengen membership has been a strategic goal for the country, Bucharest will persist in acting responsibly to safeguard and enhance the EU’s external borders to effectively address illegal migration.

During a news briefing, a spokeswoman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, emphasized that Russian nationals could find themselves in serious trouble while traveling in the West. Russia Scaring Tourists With ‘US Kidnapping’ Abroad “In the context of the increasing confrontation in Russian-American relations, which are teetering on the verge of rupture due to the fault of Washington, trips to the United States of America privately or out of official necessity are fraught with serious risks,” she said. Russian national should also avoid traveling to Canada and to US ‘allied satellite states’ in the European Union, the spokeswoman added. Recently, both Russia and the United States have exchanged the accusations that US nationals are being arrested based on unfounded charges while traveling in Russia and vice versa. According to the diplomats from both Russia and the United States, the relationship between the two nations is at its lowest point since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, primarily as a result of Russia’s continued military aggression in Ukraine. The United States government had also warned its citizens against traveling to Russia, indicating that they may encounter harassment or detention by Russian security personnel, as well as the arbitrary application of local laws based on their nationality. According to the United States Embassy in Moscow, it no longer offers non-diplomatic visa services due to the Russian government prohibiting the Embassy from employing foreign nationals in any capacity. Russian nationals may continue applying for nonimmigrant visas at any US embassy or consulate where they can obtain an appointment. Due to the suspension of immigrant visa services at the US Embassy in Moscow, the US Department of State has designated the US Embassy in Warsaw to process immigrant visas for residents of Russia. The US Department of State also added US Embassy Tashkent and US Consulate General Almaty as processing posts for Russian IR-5 (parent of a US citizen) immigrant visa applicants. We are not processing boarding foils at this time. “We regret that the actions of the Russian government have made it impossible for our office to continue offering non-diplomatic visa services in Russia. All consular services at the U.S. Consulates in Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok remain in suspended status.” US Embassy added. The United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has also advised UK nationals against all travel to Russia due to the risks and threats from its continuing invasion of Ukraine, including: security incidents, such as drone attacks, in parts of the country lack of flights to return to the UK limited ability for the UK government to provide support There is also a high likelihood terrorists will try to carry out attacks, including in major cities. UK nationals have also been warned of limited UK government support: “The British Embassy in Moscow and British Consulate in Ekaterinburg are open, but the situation could change at short notice. In-person UK government support in Russia is limited. It is very limited in parts of Russia because of the security situation and the size of the country, particularly in the North Caucasus.” Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel
Jamaica Transforms Industry Through Certification of 3500 Tourism Workers,https://eturbonews.com/jamaica-transforms-industry-through-certification-of-3500-tourism-workers/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 10, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"Speaking at the second annual Jamaica Centre for Tourism Innovation (JCTI) Awards and Recognition Ceremony at the Montego Bay Convention Centre in Rose Hall on Thursday (December 5), Minister Bartlett commended the accomplishments of over 3,500 tourism industry workers and high school students who earned international certifications during the financial year. These individuals were recognized for achieving qualifications in disciplines ranging from lifeguarding to customer service and hotel management. “This graduation ceremony is the culmination of a series of preparations with various international certification institutions and partners, such as AHLEI, ACF, HEART/NSTA Trust and the Ministry of Education,” said the Minister. “These designations are critical as they are part of the pivot we are taking to enable a professional industry.” Minister Bartlett stressed the importance of professionalizing the tourism sector to ensure its sustainability and called for a departure from the outdated perception of tourism workers as casual laborers. He noted the significant challenges casual workers face, including limited tenure, restricted mobility, and inadequate remuneration. The Minister underscored that a reformed labor market would promote equity, merit-based systems, and accurate valuation of workers’ contributions, leading to greater confidence and job security among employees. “The pivot for us is to create a new labor market arrangement in tourism where workers can feel far more confident in their tenure,” he explained. “The value of their labor must be properly assessed and remunerated. That’s the fix, and for those who are anxious for us to fix it, that’s how we will fix it.” Minister Bartlett also addressed the financial pressures tourism businesses face, particularly their reliance on casual labor to control costs, which he identified as a source of industrial disruption. “Labor, in most instances, represents the largest percentage of costs in companies, and tourism is highly labor-intensive,” he pointed out. “Consider a hotel employing 2,000 or 3,000 people, with 70 or 80 percent being casual labor who are not certified, not classified, and not remunerated according to classification. This causes industrial disruptions as people don’t have a sense of their true value in the workplace, and they take what they get.” Amidst these challenges, the JCTI has emerged as a pivotal force in preparing a skilled and certified workforce to meet global standards. The organization, a division of the Tourism Enhancement Fund (TEF), has been instrumental in advancing human capital development in Jamaica’s tourism sector. The Minister’s vision for the future includes a reimagined labor market where tourism workers enjoy greater job security, fair compensation aligned with their qualifications, and a sense of value and belonging in the industry. This initiative aligns seamlessly with JCTI’s mandate to support innovation and human capital development in the tourism sector, positioning Jamaica as a global leader in workforce excellence. SEEN IN IMAGE: Tourism Minister, Hon. Edmund Bartlett, delivers the keynote address at the JCTI Awards and Recognition Ceremony on Thursday, December 5, 2024, at the Montego Bay Convention Centre.

By November 30, 2024, the policy had been extended to 38 countries, predominantly European, with the maximum duration of stay increased to 30 days. Additionally, the policy reflects enhanced flexibility by accommodating travel for exchange purposes. Three More China Entry Ports are Visa-Free Now This policy enables holders of ordinary passports to visit China for a duration of up to 30 days for purposes such as business, tourism, visiting family and friends, exchange visits, and transit. According to China’s foreign ministry, this initiative aims to enhance international travel and stimulate both tourism and business travel. The policy also includes: An extension of the visa-free stay period from 15 days to 30 days The inclusion of exchange visits as a legitimate reason for entry Additionally, on November 7, 2024, China entered into a mutual visa exemption agreement with the Solomon Islands, which will come into effect once both nations finalize their respective domestic legal processes. China’s unilateral visa-free policy has led to a significant increase in international arrivals. In the third quarter of 2024, the country recorded nearly 8.2 million inbound trips by foreign visitors, reflecting a year-on-year growth of 48.8 percent. Notably, approximately 4.9 million of these entries were made under the visa-free provision, representing an impressive 78.6 percent increase compared to the same timeframe in 2023. Air China’s Geneva office has reported a substantial rise in passenger traffic. Following the implementation of the visa exemption on March 14, the Geneva-Beijing route has accommodated around 29,000 passengers by November 30, which is an 80 percent increase from the previous year. This surge in travel has also generated considerable activity on social media, with “China Travel” emerging as a leading trending topic across major platforms such as Facebook and TikTok. China’s new policy is fostering cultural exchange, allowing visitors to gain firsthand experiences that challenge stereotypes and enhance their understanding of the country’s social and economic landscape. Large European corporations, such as German major car makers Mercedes-Benz and BMW, have acknowledged the influence of the policy in facilitating business travel and bolstering investor confidence. Additionally, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have reaped advantages, as managers are now better positioned to participate in exhibitions and meetings in China. According to the chief economist of the World Trade Organization, China’s new visa-free policy is a significant catalyst for global trade in services and investment. He emphasized that amidst a period of slow global economic recovery and increasing protectionist measures, the enhancements to China’s visa policy instill confidence and drive momentum in the global economy, thereby fostering economic globalization. The visa-free policy constitutes a significant aspect of China’s unilateral opening-up strategies, which also encompass the liberalization of the domestic market for foreign businesses and the organization of the China International Import Expo. In conjunction with multilateral and bilateral opening-up efforts, including China’s accession to the WTO and various free trade agreements, these initiatives have fostered a beneficial cycle of trade between China and the global community.

Seychelles Tourism Helping Small Operators with Low Season,https://eturbonews.com/seychelles-tourism-helping-small-operators-with-low-season/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 6, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"Running from November 18 to December 6, the 11 sessions across Mahé, Praslin, and La Digue target operators looking to enhance their business strategies for managing both high and low tourist seasons, ensuring year-round sustainability. The initiative has attracted strong participation, with around 90 candidates taking part. With the Praslin and La Digue sessions already completed, the remaining sessions for Mahé will conclude shortly. Feedback will be collected to assess the sessions’ effectiveness and plans are already underway to organize further sessions next year to extend the benefits of this program. Seychelles’ low seasons, particularly in May and June, pose a significant challenge for many small operators due to a sharp drop in visitor numbers. Other low-season periods include the post-Christmas and New Year’s period, as well as September, following the European school holidays. According to the Principal Secretary for the Tourism Department, Mrs. Sherin Francis, the low season of May/June was particularly difficult for small operators. “We noticed that this year, the low season was more pronounced, especially in May and June,” she said. “Some small operators are still struggling to adjust and optimize their revenue. When demand is high, they need to capitalize on that demand, and when demand is low, they need to adjust prices and offer special promotions to ensure consistent revenue.” Mrs. Francis added: “We want our small operators to optimize their revenue so that they are prepared for both the high and low tourist seasons.” “This training is an opportunity for them to seize strategies that will benefit their businesses and ensure that, when the next low season arrives, they are fully prepared.” Making up the bigger share of rooms in Seychelles, these small operators including small hotels, guesthouses, self-caterings are a vital component of Seychelles’ tourism economy, accounting for 57.36% of the total number of rooms across the islands. Mrs. Francis emphasized that given their significant share in the Seychelles tourism landscape, it is even more crucial to support and encourage their performance, as their success directly impacts the country’s overall economic health. The training sessions are free, requiring only one-days’ time and commitment from participants. Each session is designed to provide practical, actionable insights into revenue optimization and how to better manage business operations during varying tourist seasons. “We are confident this initiative will offer lasting advantages,” Mrs. Francis said. “By equipping our small operators to navigate off-peak seasons, we are empowering them with the facilities to better manage their income and secure their long-term sustainability.” The Tourism Department is committed to continuing and expanding the program in the future. As Seychelles prepares to tackle the low-season revenue challenges for 2025, these sessions provide an important step toward building resilience in the small tourism sector, enabling them to thrive throughout the year.

Enticing Tourists by Making Tourism Enchanting,https://eturbonews.com/enticing-tourists-by-making-tourism-enchanting/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%2081'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 5, 2024",N/A,Dr. Peter E. Tarlow,"Millions of people around the world suffer from illnesses and diseases, poverty and loneliness. There are many ways that we can all fight these social negatives. For those who have can afford to travel, travel and tourism can add, if only for a few days or weeks, enchantment back into our lives. Travel is not always accessible. Climate activists have caused airline prices and other forms of transportation to become unaffordable for the masses. Hotels have become so expensive that many in the middle class can no longer afford to stay in them, and restaurants have become unaffordable, especially for families. Tourism is also challenged by the fact that businesses have begun to find alternative ways to communicate and often find that internet meetings are not only less costly but equally or even more efficient. All of the above reasons are valid, but from the perspective of travel and tourism, they are passive events over which the industry often has little control. If the travel and tourism industry is to succeed in these hard times, it must do more than merely see itself as a victim of the economy or other people’s evil. It must also examine itself to see where it too can improve. Perhaps the greatest threat to the leisure industry (and to a lesser extent to the business travel industry) is the fact that travel has lost a good deal of its romance and enchantment. In its rush for efficiency and quantitative analysis, the travel and tourism industry may have forgotten that each traveler represents a world unto him/herself and personal quality must always override quantity. For tourism to succeed in difficult times it must never forget that our clients seek enchantment and beautiful memories and these come not from machines but from the warmth of human beings and smiles. When there is a lack of enchantment, there are also fewer reasons to want to travel and to participate in the tourism experience. For example, if every shopping mall looks the same or if the same menu exists in every hotel chain, why not simply stay at home? Why would anyone want to subject him/herself to dangers and the hassles of travel, if the journey’s enchantment is destroyed by rude and arrogant front-line personnel? To help your locale or attraction put a bit of the romance and enchantment back into your industry, Tourism Tidbits offers the following suggestions. Emphasize the unique in your community Do not try to be all things to all people. Represent something that is special. Ask yourself: What makes your community or attraction different and unique from your competitors? How does your community celebrate its individuality? If you were a visitor to your community, would you remember it a few days after you had left, or would it be just one more place on the map? For example, do not just offer an outdoor experience, but individualize that experience, make your hiking trails special, or develop something special about your beaches or river experience. If, on the other hand, your community or destination is a creation of the imagination, then allow the imagination to run wild and continually create new experiences. Create enchantment through product development Advertise less and give more. Always exceed expectations and never overstate your case. The best form of marketing is a good product and good service. Provide what you promise at prices that are reasonable. The public understands that seasonal locations have to earn their year’s wages in a few months. Higher prices may be acceptable, but gauging never is. Enchantment comes from the people who serve the public If your employees hate tourists, then the message they are giving is one that destroys a sense of being special. Often managers are more interested in their own ego trips than in the vacationer’s experience. An employee who is unique, funny, or makes people go away feeling special is worth thousands of dollars in advertising. Every tourism manager and hotel GM ought to do every job in his or her industry at least once a year. Often tourism managers push so hard for the bottom line that they forget the humanity of their employees. Be with the visitors and see the world through their eyes. Assess the areas of your tourism experience that destroy enchantment For example, are people subjected to: • lines that are too long • a lack of shelter from the weather, sun, wind, cold, etc. • rude service personnel • personnel that neither listen nor care • traffic jams and airport hassles • a lack of adequate parking • no one who is willing to listen to or own a complaint If so, these are some of the elements that transform a positive travel experience into a negative one. Check for ways that you can recreate enchantment To do this, work with specialists in such areas as lighting, landscaping, color coordination, exterior and interior decorations, street appearances and city themes, parking lots and internal transportation service. Utilitarian devices, such as the San Francisco trolley cars, can be vehicles of enchantment if they enhance the environment and add something special to a particular place. Coordinate festivals and other events with the ambiance of the place Festivals often do best when they are integrated within the community rather than taking place outside of town. In-town festivals that are part of the community’s genre not only add to the charm but can be a boom to local businesses rather than a reason for money to leak out of the community. Create a safe and secure atmosphere There can be little enchantment if people are afraid. To create such an atmosphere, local security professionals must be part of the planning from the beginning. Tourism security is more than merely having police or security professionals hanging around a site. Tourism security requires psychological and sociological analysis; use of hardware, interesting and unique uniforms, and careful planning that integrates the security professional into the enchantment experience. Enchantment oriented communities realize that everyone in the community has a part to play in creating a positive tourism experience and one that creates a unique and special environment not only for the visitor but also for those who live in the community. Be a bit outlandish If the other communities are building golf courses, then build something else. Think of your community or destination as another country. People do not want the same food, language, and styles that they have back home. Sell not only the experience but also the memory, by being different from other destinations. Never forget that we dare not take our customers for granted. The visitor does not have to go on vacation nor travel to our destination. When we begin to take people for granted, then in the end, we destroy our greatest asset – namely our reputation. Dr. Peter Tarlow The author, Dr. Peter E.

Jamaica Tourism Positions to Attract Luxury Developments,https://eturbonews.com/jamaica-tourism-positions-to-attract-luxury-developments/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 5, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"“We are now looking at how to enable more of this type of investment that LCH Developments has brought to Jamaica,” said Minister of Tourism, Hon. Edmund Bartlett at a landmark conference on branded real estate development, hosted by the Pinnacle developers at the Montego Bay Convention Centre yesterday (December 4). “This for us, is a pivotal point, and whilst we are going to be continuing to build out the elements of tourism that drive the demand for more production in various areas of the economy, we’re going to be placing concerted focus on luxury tourism as a critical part of the differentiation of the Jamaican experience,” he added. Minister Bartlett said this was in keeping with the Blue Ocean Strategy for growth that the Ministry of Tourism and its public bodies developed in 2021. That strategy speaks to reimagining Jamaica’s tourism by identifying and establishing “innovative policies, systems, protocols, and standards that assure our visitors a safer, secure, and seamless experience, while building out a new national tourism model, based on a diversified portfolio of unique and authentic attractions and activities, which draw heavily on Jamaica’s natural and cultural assets.” Minister Bartlett envisaged that the Blue Ocean strategy would “lay the foundation for the emergence of a new, more inclusive form of tourism.” He told conference participants that “operating under the Blue Ocean Strategy demands of us that we pivot in this direction” and congratulated Pinnacle “as the new pioneer in this pivot.” He added that “we’re excited about the prospect of you being able to bring new demographics into Jamaica, but more importantly, to have Jamaicans investing in this whole area so that the ownership of tourism becomes more and more that of the people of Jamaica.” Building Out a Luxury Experience Speaking to the need for “building out a luxury experience in Jamaica,” the tourism minister said “we have, in the last 20 years, tinkered around it and we really haven’t done enough to create that luxury experience with the kind of structure and the investment that is required for it. Also, the type of regulatory and legislative arrangements that surround it, so in the new approach that we’re looking at, we’re going to pivot.” He posited that attracting this demographic in the tourism space would create more demand for goods and services from various sub-sectors, boosting consumption in both quantity and quality resulting in higher returns, which also offers more employment opportunities. He stated that: “we are going to have to zone our areas and develop specific areas for different types of products, St. Thomas is being positioned for luxury tourism development as well.” Mr Bartlett said with the four expansive 28-story Pinnacle towers, with 423 residences ranging from one-bedroom apartments to lavish penthouses, as well as 15 exclusive villas, LCH was setting the stage for that type of development. With news that a European company will soon be announced as the operator for the hotel-style services in three of the towers, Minister Bartlett said “we wanted to position you as being at the hub of this pivot in luxury tourism in Jamaica.” SEEN IN IMAGE: Minister of Tourism, Hon.

US Billionaire Space Tourist to Lead NASA Under Trump,https://eturbonews.com/us-billionaire-space-tourist-to-lead-nasa-under-trump/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 5, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"A 41-year-old US billionaire space tourist, pilot, philanthropist, and commercial astronaut, with two successful private space flights and a spacewalk on his resume, has been nominated by President-elect Trump to become the next Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Jared Isaacman, the billionaire CEO of Shift4 payments company and a close associate of another US billionaire, Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, is poised to succeed the current NASA administrator, Bill Nelson, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and has also traveled into orbit during a Space Shuttle mission in 1986. NASA NASA.gov brings you the latest news, images and videos from America’s space agency, pioneering the future in space exploration, scientific discovery and aeronautics research. Three years ago, he spearheaded the first-ever all-civilian space mission aboard a commercial SpaceX flight. In 2024, Isaacman headed the Polaris Dawn mission, during which SpaceX’s civilian astronauts performed the first private spacewalk. Polaris Dawn aimed to evaluate new technologies and protocols that may become instrumental in upcoming space missions. The spacewalk was streamed live and lasted approximately two hours. Are There Trillions of Dollars in Space? In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote upon the nomination that Isaacman would “lead NASA’s initiative focused on discovery and inspiration, setting the stage for significant advancements in space science, technology, and exploration.” NASA maintains a close business partnership with SpaceX, depending on the company’s rocket launches to transport astronauts to space and deliver various supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). Should Isaacman be confirmed as NASA administrator, he would be responsible for overseeing the multibillion-dollar contracts that the US government has granted to Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Upon learning about the nomination, Isaacman said that he is thankful for the opportunity to “usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.” He also addressed the Shift4 employees in the letter, where he stated his intention to continue serving as CEO until his confirmation, and to maintain the majority of his equity stake, although he will diminish his voting power as a shareholder. “After nearly 26 years at the helm of Shift4, I believe the moment has arrived for me to pursue a new path,” the entrepreneur wrote.

Swindlers Targeting US Travelers Overseas,https://eturbonews.com/swindlers-targeting-us-travelers-overseas/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 4, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Each year, millions of Americans travel outside of the United States, and it creates numerous opportunities for the foreign con artists that target unsuspecting tourists. These fraudulent schemes often involve the extortion or theft of money, posing significant risks for vacationers, students, businessmen, and other US travelers visiting traveling abroad. From Eiffel Tower to Louvre: World’s worst pickpocket hotspots FRAUDULENT RESERVATION SCHEMES When planning an upcoming foreign trip, US travelers must remain vigilant against various online scams designed to deceive them. These may include fraudulent offers for hotels, flights, and vacation packages advertised through social media or sent directly via email, often appearing to be too good to be true. One may also receive emails regarding fake cancellations or be redirected to a realistic imitation of a legitimate website, prompting you to enter your personal and financial information. These tricks are designed to extract additional funds from you bank account or your credit card, or to get a hold of your sensitive personal data. It is vital to verify the validity and legitimacy of URL of any website you visit and refrain from clicking on suspicious links. Make sure you search directly for the hotel or airline to verify whether the offers are legitimate or merely too good to be true. TAXI FARE SWINDLES Many US travelers have also become victims of unscrupulous taxi drivers who would charge exorbitant amounts for their services. Taxi drivers may use a meter that increases too rapidly or may try to negotiate a fare with the rider without using the meter altogether. Confirming the expected cost of your ride in advance would give you a significant advantage and a peace of mind. The traveler can also run into an unlicensed taxi operator, which even though while appearing legitimate, would lack a proper meter or safety certification. Such unlicensed taxis may demand even higher fares or take you to the wrong destinations. To make sure that your taxi ride is safe and fair taxi, ask for help from your hotel staff or the official tourist board in arranging a taxi ride, since they are acquainted with reputable taxi operators. At all times, avoid entering any unlicensed taxis and do not hesitate to ask the driver to pull over if the fare seems unusual. If the negotiated fare appears reasonable, finalize the price before starting your journey to avoid any unexpected charges. ‘FREE PRESENT’ CONS The ‘free gift’ scam typically involves a person who appears friendly and benevolent, and offers you a bracelet, hat, or some other small item presented as a ‘free present.’ Later, they will typically demand payment from you for the item ‘gifted’ to you, and may create a public scene to pressure you into complying, by trying avoiding any potential embarrassment. Another similar tactic has a person offering to take your photograph, only to later demand money for ‘services rendered.’ It is very important to be vigilant when approached by strangers offering something for free and maintain the resolve to disengage at once from situations that may lead to coercion. If a stranger places an item on you, it is prudent to reject it or give it back at once. Simply walking away can be an indicator that you are not a target worth chasing. Typically scammers would not pursue their tactics after such a retort. INCORRECT CHANGE SCHEMES It is also very important to acquaint yourself with the local currency and accurately count any change received, as some local vendors may try to deliberately shortchange you or even cheat you out of the change you are owed entirely. Dishonest traders quite often assume that foreign visitors will be in a hurry and may not pay close attention to the amount received. Shortchange scams are particularly common in countries where the local bank notes are similar in appearance or in environments where some distractions can easily interfere with the transactions. Con artists may hand you back a handful of coins, expecting you to accept the change without counting it. Do not hesitate to count your change to make sure that you receive the correct amount, even if a line of customers is long and you feel pressured to move on. It is also beneficial to familiarize yourself with the various denominations of coins and bills in advance, to make sure you can tell whether you are being shortchanged. ‘FRIENDLY LOCAL’ HUSTLES While there are many people who may offer you a genuine assistance, there will be a number of grifters aiming to create a deceptive sense of trust. These con artists often approach unsuspecting victims in public spaces, offering to direct them to a particular location or asking for help with an unexpected expense. Such scams can occur in many different ways, and may include a friendly person inviting you to a restaurant or a bar planning to run a substantial tab that you will be left to cover, or a local resident leading you to a store or a market with pricey items, pressuring you into making a purchase. It is very important to remain cautious when approached by strangers and to critically assess their motives for seeking your assistance or offering something seemingly pleasant. It is strongly recommended to continue with your activities and firmly decline their offers, even if they are being persistent in their approach. PICKPOCKET CREWS Foreign visitors also frequently become targets of single pickpockets or organized groups, especially in crowded locations known for high crime rates. Pickpockets often see foreign travelers as more susceptible to deception, assuming they may be carrying cash or valuables on their person. Distraction techniques used by these thieves may include bumping into victims and offering assistance in retrieving dropped belongings, striking conversation with potential victims while an accomplice steals from them, or diverting attention to nearby attractions or performances while theft occurs among the audience. To protect ones valuable possessions, it is strongly recommended to leave them in hotel safes and remain alert, as thieves typically focus on outer pockets or bags that are easily accessible. Consider investing in anti-theft devices, such as locks and hidden compartments, and remain cautious of unexpected physical interactions.

She talked about the importance of sustainable tourism for the future of the country’s tourism sector, saying: “The recognition is a testament to the country’s commitment to support sustainable tourism, community empowerment, and environmental eco-friendly practices.

Intoxicated Delta Crew Removed from Amsterdam-New York JFK Flight,https://eturbonews.com/intoxicated-delta-crew-removed-from-amsterdam-new-york-jfk-flight/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","December 3, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"A pair of US Delta Air Lines flight attendants have failed a pre-departure alcohol test in Amsterdam and were removed from an international flight by Dutch officials. According to airport officials, a random breathalyzer test conducted prior to Delta Air Lines flight from Amsterdam to New York’s JFK International Airport revealing that Delta’s female flight attendant had a blood alcohol level seven times above the legal limit for airline personnel, while her male counterpart registered a level of 0.02. During a three-hour inspection period, police checked 445 pilots and flight attendants at Schiphol Airport, flagging three individuals. General European civil aviation regulations forbid flight attendants from consuming alcohol, while the Netherlands has its own particular rule that bans alcohol consumption by the pilots and the cabin crew members within ten hours prior to a flight. However, the European Air Safety Agency (EASA) cautions that merely following the guidelines on abstinence period does not ensure compliance with the legal standards regarding alcohol consumption. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) dictates a minimum of eight hours between alcohol consumption and flying, and mandates that employees be relieved of their duties if their blood alcohol concentration reaches 0.02 or higher on the required testing. Dutch officials fined Delta Air Lines female employee €1,900 (about $2,000), and male flight attendant received a fine of €275 (about $290). Additionally, a flight attendant from a different airline was penalized €1,800 (about $1,900) for being 6.5 times over the limit. A representative for the Atlanta-based airline stated that this incident did not impact the flight and after the said crew members were reassigned from their planned duties, the flight proceeded as scheduled. “Delta’s alcohol policy is recognized as one of the most stringent in the industry, and we maintain a zero-tolerance stance regarding any violations.” the carrier’s representative added.

BIT 2025 Observatory Presents Travel Trends for the Upcoming Holidays,https://eturbonews.com/bit-2025-observatory-presents-travel-trends-for-the-upcoming-holidays/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 27, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"The holiday season is approaching and, this year more than ever, travel trends appear diversified and, therefore, full of opportunities for operators . Many travellers are looking for unique and authentic experiences , with a strong interest in hotter and more exotic destinations. However, there is no shortage of those seeking out adventure , even in cold climates, and interest in Italy , is also strong, with travellers choosing art, wellness and food and wine. The BIT 2025 Observatory – the leading tourism exhibition in Italy, on at fieramilano – Rho from 9 to 11 February 2025 – brought together and analysed some of the most interesting predictions. Calculating an average based on the data of the main Italian TOs, the Observatory predicts that at least 60% of our compatriots plan to spend Christmas elsewhere, with a significant increase in demand for trips abroad compared to previous years. Long-haul destinations tend to favour warm weather and adventure In particular, there is a growing interest in trips that combine adventure and relaxation , with tours in countries that offer both wild nature and white sandy beaches and crystal clear waters : Caribbean destinations top the popularity stakes, such as the evergreen Dominican Republic , where ‘sun and sea’ holidays are joined by large wild natural parks and striking Hispanic locations with their traditions. According to the Caribbean Hotel & Tourism Association , arrivals in the region have already increased by 13% compared to last year. The numbers of Central American destinations are higher still, such as El Salvador , which is increasing in popularity with its mix of natural parks, volcanoes, Mayan ruins and surprising inland lakes. According to data from the WTTC , the country is leading the growth in the region and has seen a 3-digit increase of no less than 157% compared to 2023. The increase of Nicaragua (+142%) also reached 3 figures and Guatemala (+52%), Honduras (+49%), Costa Rica (+35%), Mexico (+31%) and Colombia (+23%) did well too. On the other hand, Iceland figures among the favourite destinations of those who defy the cold . Famous for its breathtaking landscapes with the wonderful Northern Lights, as well as its volcanoes and spa waters , it is dotted with quaint Nordic-style fishing villages full of colourful houses. Destinations that not only offer the opportunity to break away from the routine, but also to immerse yourself in different cultures or lifestyles. The Bank of Iceland estimates that December 2024 will be the month with the highest growth ever for tourism to the country, with a 21.4% increase compared to 2023. Photographic safaris are still in high demand, the Observatory notes, but with many travellers opting for relatively new destinations such as Madagascar , with its lush forests rich in native fauna unique to the island. South America is one of the countries that ranks among this year’s top destinations for adventure holidays: A study by Research & Markets estimates that this year the region will finally reach its pre-pandemic levels, welcoming 40.19 million travellers . In the ‘Cono Sur’ it is worth mentioning Uruguay with its colonial cities, the pampas, the great rivers to explore and the iconic meat-based food and wine. Or again, new Asian destinations such as Vietnam , where the charm of a millenary culture blends with an unspoiled and enveloping tropical nature. Plunge into the Christmas atmosphere not far from home The analyses of the Observatory on short and medium-haul destinations reveal that, during the holidays, European capitals such as Paris, Vienna or London , famous for their particularly ostentatious Christmas scenery, remain a must for shorter stays. As for the British capital, the Tourist Board Visit Britain estimates that it will receive a record-breaking 25.1 million visits, with tourists spending almost £14 billion . For those who want to lose themselves in the festive atmosphere and spectacular illuminations while remaining in Italy, the top cities will be Milan , for its unrivalled shopping offer and decorations at the same level as the big European metropolises, and Naples , with its nativity scene tradition and the inevitable visit to the incredible creations of the artisans of San Gregorio Armeno . For the capital of Lombardy, 2024 was a record-breaking year, with arrivals now steadily above the quota of one million per month , as attested by the data of the Metropolitan City, while Naples is estimated to reach 14 million visitors by the end of the year. For travellers who, on the other hand, want to explore the classic Northern European-style Christmas markets , the key destinations remain those of the northeast, while for those seeking something new this year the markets of Calabria, Veneto, Lombardy, Apulia offer a variety of options. And for New Year’s Eve? For New Year’s Eve, according to the BIT 2025 Observatory, the main trend is the search for destinations that combine a great tradition of outdoor parties , with light shows and entertainment, offering a range of clubs where visitors can party after midnight until the early hours of the morning. In this sense, one of the most sought-after destinations in Europe remains London, between its fireworks over the River Thames and parties in the neighbourhoods combined with a vast variety of nightclubs in iconic neighbourhoods such as Soho, Camden or the West End of the theatres. Not to mention the area of the museums on the Left Bank and the ‘hidden gems’ to be discovered in the residential areas, such as Notting Hill or Hampstead Heath . Madrid is also experiencing a grand revival, with its ritual that involves eating twelve grapes on the twelve strokes of midnight, in the square in front of the large clock of Plaza del Sol , the heart of the Spanish capital and starting point for all the city’s streets. Then continue the night in one of the countless clubs of the famous Madrid nightlife around the Gran Vía, in Chueca , or in emerging alternative neighbourhoods such as Lavapiés . On the other hand, Central and Eastern Europe stand out among the emerging destinations of this year, where outdoor events and grand celebrations take on a Central European allure that Italian travellers seem to appreciate very much. Budapest , in particular, is a novelty, offering lively squares and enchanted atmospheres along the Danube while Berlin confirms its place at the top of the rankings for younger travellers: not only for the traditional big party at the Brandenburg Gate , but also for the wide choice of discos that animate the techno and house scene. Berlin also remains one of the most popular LGBTQ+ destinations in Europe, a constantly growing market segment. For those who want a quieter and more family atmosphere, the East also offers the Habsburg charm of the ‘small’ capitals such as Ljubljana, Zagreb and Bratislava , as well as the evergreen Prague . In Italy, Venice is still a popular romantic destination, ideal for a special evening strolling among the canals and visiting St. Mark’s Square, while Rome or Turin , among the others, continue to offer concerts and shows for those who prefer a classic New Year’s Eve. A classic New Year’s Eve is on offer at the sea in Liguria while nature and history are the main themes of the celebrations in the villages and cities of Umbria . When it comes to the long haul, on the other hand, the BIT 2025 Observatory notes that many Italian households are choosing New York , to admire the famous crystal ball in Times Square , or Dubai , with its spectacular fireworks displays around the Burj Khalifa . Those looking for a New Year’s Eve in warm locations also consider the beaches of Rio de Janeiro for a unique experience combining music and dancing on the sand. An eye on the budget and the other on timing It should be said, in any case that travellers are trying to optimise costs. According to the community Weroad, approximately 70% of Italians are planning trips with a set budget , taking advantage of offers & packages . Flexibility becomes a priority, with many choosing to book trips that can be cancelled or changed without penalty. The data of a Jetcost search engine survey are substantially in line with this estimate. They confirm that 71% of Italians intend to travel in the upcoming holidays and many have already booked, taking advantage of prices that are 25% lower than the offers closer to the date of departure, committing a budget of about 800 euros per person . According to the study, only 8% will wait until the last few days to take advantage of last-minute deals, while 21% is not planning to travel at all. All these destinations and trends will be showcased in BIT 2025, at fieramilano – Rho from 9 to 11 February 2025 , so that visitors can plan ahead for next year’s holidays. BIT 2025 will also be open to travellers on Sunday 9 February and only to operators on Monday 10 and Tuesday 11 February .

Their vehicle veered off a bridge that was undergoing significant repairs and was subsequently discovered by local residents. The deceased were en route from Noida, a city located in Uttar Pradesh approximately 12.5 miles (20 kilometers) southeast of New Delhi, to Faridpur to attend a wedding. It has been reported that Google Maps directed the driver onto the incomplete bridge, which had a section that had previously collapsed due to flood damage. There were no barriers or warning signs on the bridge. In connection with the incident, four engineers have been taken into police custody, according to the local media. Additionally, the regional officer of Google Maps is also under investigation, according to the report. In the aftermath of the accident, municipal authorities have been instructed to conduct inspections of all roads and bridges in the vicinity to avert similar incidents in the future. Local officials reported that a section of the bridge was damaged during a flood earlier this year. Nevertheless, these alterations have not yet been reflected in the navigation system, as stated by Ashutosh Shivam, a police officer from Faridpur. In the meantime, a representative from Google expressed condolences and affirmed the company’s commitment to assisting with the investigation. “We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the affected families. We are collaborating closely with the authorities and offering our support to address the matter,” the representative stated. Google Maps reportedly has approximately 60 million active users in India and has mapped over 7 million kilometers of roads within the nation, as stated in a blog post by the company earlier this year. The organization mentioned that it employs a custom-built artificial intelligence strategy to address challenges related to narrow roads and flyovers, facilitate sustainable travel through the integration of electric vehicle charging stations, and empower the largest community of map contributors to identify real-time road disruptions. Furthermore, the company has enhanced the app’s interface to simplify the reporting of incidents such as crashes, slowdowns, construction activities, lane closures, stalled vehicles, and obstacles on the roadway. Local competitors, including MapMyIndia and Ola Maps, have been competing with the American technology giant by emphasizing region-specific functionalities and offline usability; however, they still represent only a minor portion of the consumer navigation market.

Disney Settles Women’s Pay Class Action Lawsuit for $43 Million,https://eturbonews.com/disney-settles-womens-pay-class-action-lawsuit-for-43-million/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 26, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Disney announced that it has reached an agreement to pay $43.25 million to resolve a lawsuit that accused the prominent entertainment company of compensating female employees less than their male counterparts in equivalent positions. The proposed settlement is set to be reviewed and potentially approved by a judge in January of the upcoming year. This pay equity class action, which has been a concern for the company for the last five years, originated from a lawsuit filed in 2019 by LaRonda Rasmussen. She alleged that Disney ‘s compensation practices were influenced by gender rather than performance. Rasmussen reported discovering that six men holding the same job title received significantly higher salaries than she did, including one individual with fewer years of experience who earned 20,000 U.S. dollars more annually than her. Over the past five years, approximately 9,000 women, both former and current employees, have joined the lawsuit as the company consistently challenged the claims and declined to acknowledge any wrongdoing. The lawsuit fundamentally asserted that Disney had breached the Fair Employment & Housing Act as well as California’s Equal Pay Act by compensating male employees at a higher rate than their female counterparts for identical roles. As per documents submitted later on Monday evening in the Los Angeles Superior Court, the company has ultimately consented to settle the lawsuit by issuing a financial payment. This settlement will potentially benefit up to 14,000 eligible female Disney employees who have been with the company from 2015 to the present. It is important to note that the class action and the associated financial compensation do not extend to women employed at Hulu, ESPN, Pixar, or former Fox properties such as FX or National Geographic. A spokesperson for Disney stated: “We have always been committed to paying our employees fairly and have demonstrated that commitment throughout this case, and we are pleased to have resolved this matter.” Walt Disney World Sued for $50K Over Water Slide Wedgie Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

Twelve of the missing boat passengers are foreign tourists. The boat, identified as Sea Story, sank during a multi-day diving trip while with 44 on board, which included 31 tourists and 13 crew members. As reported by the Red Sea Governorate, 28 boat passengers were rescued with minor injuries in the aftermath of the incident. The vessel had set sail from Porto Ghalib in Marsa Alam on Sunday and was expected to return to Hurghada Marina on November 29. A distress signal was transmitted at 5:30 AM local time, and survivors were found in the vicinity of the Wadi el-Gemal area, situated south of Marsa Alam. The boat capsized near the Sataya Reef after it was struck by high waves and sank in five to seven minutes.

The Egyptian Navy warship El Fateh, along with several military aircraft, is engaged in a comprehensive search operation for the missing individuals, with rescue teams working tirelessly. As reported by Ahram Online, the Egyptian Meteorological Authority has issued alerts concerning rough sea conditions, recommending the suspension of maritime activities on Sunday and Monday due to wave heights reaching up to four meters (13 feet) in the Red Sea.

While the identities of the missing persons remain unverified, it has been confirmed that four Egyptians are among those who are unaccounted for. The Sea Story had successfully undergone a technical inspection in March 2024, obtaining a one-year safety certificate. This incident marks the second maritime accident in the region this year. In June, another vessel sank near Marsa Alam due to severe waves, although no casualties were reported. The Red Sea, renowned for its stunning coral reefs and diverse marine life, is a favored destination for diving enthusiasts and is vital to Egypt’s tourism sector. In 2023, a fire on a motorboat off Marsa Alam resulted in three British tourists going missing, while 12 others were rescued. A comparable tragedy occurred near Egypt in 2016, when a boat carrying approximately 600 migrants sank in the Mediterranean, resulting in at least 170 fatalities. 19 Russian visitors saved from sinking tour boat in Egypt Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

According to Turkish and Russian news reports, the blaze, which originated in one of the aircraft’s engines, was eventually extinguished by the airport’s emergency personnel. The aircraft, operated by budget Russian airline Azimuth, arrived in Antalya following a two-hour journey from Russia’s Black Sea resort city of Sochi on Sunday evening. Upon landing in “challenging” weather conditions, one of the two engines caught fire, releasing smoke and flames as the narrowbody jet came to a halt. Airport firefighters encircled the aircraft and eventually extinguished the fire, successfully evacuating all 87 passengers and four crew members, as reported by Turkish media. Antalya International Airport’s runway 36R was temporarily closed, leading to the diversion of incoming flights following the incident. Airport officials confirmed that there were no fatalities or injuries. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by Russia’s Rosaviatsia federal air transport agency. The Superjet 100, designed in Russia in the early 2000s, made its inaugural commercial flight in 2011. Presently, over 200 of these aircraft are operated by five Russian airlines, including the national carrier, Aeroflot. Sukhoi Superjet 100 Passenger Plane Crashes Near Moscow Despite its short history, the aircraft has a rather troubled history and had experienced five significant accidents, one of which involved a crash-landing due to a lightning strike at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow in 2019. In this incident, 41 of the 78 passengers lost their lives as a result of the crash and the ensuing fire. The pilot who conducted the disastrous emergency landing was subsequently convicted of breaching flight safety regulations and received a six-year prison sentence.

The crash happened at approximately 5:30 AM local time when the cargo jet, operated by the Spanish charter company Swiftair on behalf of the German logistics firm DHL , was en route from Leipzig, Germany to Vilnius International Airport. The aircraft went down in the Liepkalnis municipality, just feet away from a two-story residential building. Reports from local media indicate that the crash resulted in a massive fire at the site; however, the house itself was not directly affected, and its occupants were unharmed. Vilnius officials took precautionary measures by evacuating a dozen individuals from the vicinity. The incident resulted in the death of at least one of the four crew members aboard, specifically the pilot, while two other crew members, including the co-pilot, were successfully rescued from the wreckage showing the signs of life. Emergency services promptly arrived at the location, where paramedics and firefighting teams endeavored to control the blaze. According to a representative of the Fire Protection and Rescue Department, it was fortunate that the aircraft landed in the yard rather than on the house itself, thereby preventing additional deaths. Images from local news outlets depict a significant fire raging in the urban vicinity adjacent to multiple residences, with emergency personnel present at the site. Officials have assured that operations at Vilnius Airport remained unaffected by the incident. An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash is currently underway, with authorities examining the specifics of the aircraft’s descent and the subsequent fire ignited upon impact.

Flights departing from Newcastle Airport are experiencing delays of several hours, with some incoming flights redirected to Edinburgh and Belfast, while others have been cancelled. The airport has stated that personnel are diligently working to minimize disruptions amid the ongoing snowfall that has persisted throughout the morning. The storm has led to significant travel disruptions on both roads and railways nationwide, characterized by snow, heavy rain, and strong winds. An amber alert has been issued by the Met Office in the United Kingdom for the northern regions, encompassing Yorkshire and various areas of Scotland. This alert signifies a “potential risk to life and property,” raising significant concern, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly. A yellow warning for snow has been implemented across most of the UK, while the southern regions are expected to experience rainfall, which may lead to flooding. The Met Office has indicated that certain rural communities in Scotland and northern England have a “good chance of being isolated,” prompting recommendations for precautionary measures in these areas. An airport representative stated that due to Storm Bert, the facility has experienced persistent and heavy snowfall this morning. “Our snow management team is actively engaged in efforts to minimize any disruptions, and we will issue an additional update later.” “Passengers are encouraged to check our website for the most current flight information and to reach out to their respective airlines for any inquiries.” On Friday, the airport communicated via X that its operations team is extensively trained for winter conditions and is ready to respond if the weather worsens. National Highways has released a severe weather warning regarding snow on roads in the North East, cautioning about potential blizzard conditions.

IATA: Spain’s Cabin Baggage Rule Ruins Freedom of Pricing,https://eturbonews.com/iata-spains-cabin-baggage-rule-ruins-freedom-of-pricing/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 22, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has expressed strong disapproval of the Spanish government’s decision to disregard European law by eliminating cabin baggage fees for passengers in Spain and imposing a fine of EUR 179 million on airlines. This action threatens the principle of pricing freedom, which is essential for consumer choice and competition, a tenet consistently supported by the European Court of Justice. “This is an appalling decision. Far from protecting the consumer interest, this is a slap in the face of travelers who want choice. Prohibiting all airlines from charging for cabin bags means that the cost will be automatically priced into all tickets. What’s next? Forcing all hotel guests to pay for breakfast? Or charging everyone to pay for the coat-check when they buy a concert ticket? EU Law protects pricing freedom for good reason. And airlines offer a range of service models from all-inclusive to basic transport. This move by the Spanish government is unlawful and must be stopped,” said Willie Walsh, IATA ’s Director General. Consumers seek both choice and value for their expenditures. This proposed legislation would eliminate both aspects. Recent independent polling conducted by IATA among recent air travelers in Spain revealed that 97% expressed satisfaction with their most recent journey and highlighted the following preferences: – 65% indicated a preference for securing the lowest possible fare for their air ticket, opting to pay additional fees for any necessary services. – 66% concurred that there is generally adequate transparency regarding the fees imposed by airlines for various travel options. – 78% affirmed that air travel offers good value for money. – 74% reported feeling well-informed about the products and services they purchase from airlines. These results are consistent with the most recent Eurobarometer survey conducted by the European Commission, which found that 89% of travelers across Europe felt well-informed about luggage allowances. The presence of various business models—from full-service to ultra-low-cost airlines—reflects market demand, indicating that regulatory intervention in this area is unnecessary. Furthermore, ancillary revenue is crucial for the low-cost carrier business model, which has contributed to lowering prices and increasing access to air travel for lower-income demographics. Spain has a history of attempting misguided regulatory actions and imposing fines. In 2010, the Spanish government sought to enforce similar penalties and restrictions on airlines under Article 97 of Spanish Law 48/1960, a statute established during Spain’s fascist dictatorship. This initiative was invalidated by the EU Court of Justice, which cited an EU regulation that safeguards pricing freedom (Article 22 of Regulation No 1008/2008). Following the failure of this initial effort, the current initiative once again seeks to undermine pricing freedom by prioritizing another Spanish law (Article 47 of Spain’s General Law for the Defense of Consumers and Users) that contradicts the principles of pricing freedom firmly established in European law. “They failed once, and they will fail again. Consumers deserve better than this retrograde step which ignores the realities of today’s travelers. Spain’s tourism industry has grown to account for nearly 13% of the country’s GDP, with 80% of travelers arriving by air, and many of them budget conscious. Cheap air fares have played a huge role in growing this sector of the economy. The government has no competence—legal or practical—in eliminating the availability of basic airfares. The ECJ concluded this a decade ago. The EC needs to urgently step up and defend its laws which deliver benefits to consumers by protecting pricing freedom,” said Walsh. The transportation of cabin baggage incurs associated costs, primarily manifested in extended boarding durations due to the time required for passengers to stow their luggage. The efficient utilization of aircraft is a critical factor in determining airline profitability, especially in short-haul operations. An increase of 10 to 15 minutes on the ground for boarding each flight significantly diminishes the number of flights and the operational capacity of the aircraft on a daily basis. “Everyone paying more for less choice is the worst possible outcome that a regulation could deliver,” said Walsh.

Additionally, the airline will recommence its Vancouver route on 18 January 2025, with flights scheduled twice weekly. This strategic decision reflects the airline’s evolution from a regional carrier to a global airline, emphasizing the expansion of its international route network. Following a successful restructuring last year, Hong Kong Airlines has been diligently enhancing its services and broadening its operations. Through meticulous strategic planning, the airline has showcased its robust recovery capabilities by optimizing its route network and refining its fleet structure, which now encompasses over 30 destinations. This year, the number of flight sectors has fully returned to pre-pandemic levels, achieving an average passenger load factor of around 85%. The airline anticipates meeting its annual target of transporting over 5 million passengers by the conclusion of 2024. Furthermore, bookings for the Christmas and Lunar New Year periods have already reached 85%, with ski resort routes in Northeast Asia seeing a booking rate of 90%. In light of this strong demand, the airline plans to increase flight frequencies on relevant routes starting in December. In order to facilitate its business expansion, Hong Kong Airlines has made substantial additions to its fleet this year, incorporating several Airbus A330-300 wide-body aircraft to enhance its medium- to long-haul services. Furthermore, the airline has launched its inaugural A321 aircraft, which features a configuration of 220 all-economy class seats, aimed at boosting passenger capacity and improving operational efficiency. By the conclusion of this year, Hong Kong Airlines anticipates that its fleet will reach approximately 30 aircraft, with plans to continue expanding the fleet size as necessary to further enhance its capacity. The varied fleet configuration will provide increased flight flexibility and coverage, enabling passengers to enjoy convenient access from Hong Kong to sought-after tourist destinations across mainland China, Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, Australia, the United States, Canada, and Europe. In addition to managing its own routes, the airline will persist in collaborating with partners to broaden its codeshare network, facilitate seamless sea-land-air intermodal transportation, and endeavor to enhance service diversity.

French Travel Agents Earn “Seychelles SMART” Training,https://eturbonews.com/french-travel-agents-earn-seychelles-smart-training/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 21, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"From November 6-11, 2024, these agents participated in a familiarization (FAM) trip to Seychelles, marking a milestone in their journey toward becoming Seychelles experts. Accompanying the group were Mrs. Maryse William, Senior Marketing Executive at Tourism Seychelles, and Mr. Cengiz Ozok, Senior Commercial Attaché from Turkish Airlines. The agents had the opportunity to experience Turkish Airlines’ seamless flights, which resumed service to Seychelles in late October 2024— a major boost for enhancing connectivity and enriching travel experiences to our island paradise. For over 15 years, the “Seychelles SMART” program has been pivotal in the French market, equipping travel agents with the expertise to offer unparalleled experiences to their clients. The program consists of three stages. First, agents participate in a half-day training organized by Tourism Seychelles. They then complete and validate five Seychelles travel sales, which include international flights and local services. The final stage is a FAM trip to Seychelles, culminating in a certification ceremony where agents receive diplomas and a window sticker, recognizing them as “Seychelles Smart” certified agents. The agents’ journey concluded with an awards ceremony on the final evening, where they received certificates that acknowledged their expertise and commitment to promoting Seychelles. This accolade, symbolized by a certification sticker for their agencies, highlights their role as trusted experts in selling Seychelles. Tourism Seychelles extends its heartfelt gratitude to all partners who contributed to making this FAM trip an exceptional experience.

"Delays, Cancellations, Strikes Summarize a Rough Year for Business Travelers",https://eturbonews.com/delays-cancellations-strikes-summarize-a-rough-year-for-business-travelers/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 21, 2024",N/A,Juergen T Steinmetz,"A business travel company published its second annual Travel Disruption Report. The data reveals that travel disruptions continue to significantly impact businesses and their employees worldwide, with 78% of business travelers impacted during their work trips in 2024. The findings show that while overall disruption rates remain similar to 2023, the causes vary significantly by region, with cancellations and strikes particularly affecting European markets. The insights are based on global research commissioned by this travel company in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Spain, surveying 4,000 business travelers, as well as third-party global aviation data analyzed by TravelPerk. The 2024 study reveals that more than one in four (27%) business travelers faced cancellations this year when traveling for work, while over a fifth (21%) experienced disruptions due to weather events and transport strikes. Google and Sabre Combat Environmental Impact of Business Travel The significant impact of travel disruption affects business and employees. Of those polled, 41% had missed or were late for an in-person meeting with a customer due to travel disruptions, and 40% incurred additional costs such as paying for a hotel and rebooking fees. To make up for lost time, over one-third (36%) of business travelers had to work extra hours to catch up on missed work, and 85% said that their work productivity was impacted by these disruptions. Perhaps to combat these disruptions, more and more travelers (23%) are extending their trips to stay overnight, rather than return on the day. Regional data shows striking disparities in how different markets are affected. British and German business travelers faced the highest impact from transport strikes (27% and 29% respectively) compared to just 9% in the US. Meanwhile, US travelers experienced the most cancellations during the period analyzed (139,777 flights were canceled from March to September 2024), and the highest rate of weather-related disruptions at 30%, significantly above the global average of 21%. And it is not just weather and strikes that are impacting travel. Shockwaves were sent through the global travel industry this July due to the IT outage caused by a Crowdstrike. In July, just 57% of flights operated with no delay. While the US has the highest volume of cancellations, analysis of third-party flight data reveals that China now leads in terms of cancellation rates at nearly 5%, followed by Canada (3%) and the US (3%). This represents a shift from 2023, when Indonesia topped the list at 13%. Tomasz Wrzaszcz, Travel Intelligence Specialist at TravelPerk said: “Though each region faces unique challenges, the end result for business travelers is the same: more time spent in airports, train stations or bus depots, and fewer hours of both productive working or time at home. For the TravelPerk disruptions team, it is essential to try and predict these events ahead of time, and proactively notify travelers and try to offer them multiple solutions to consider. Our priority is to help travelers to feel in control when the uncontrollable happens.” “Travel can be unpredictable. At any moment travelers have to navigate weather changes, geo-political impact or technical faults leaving them feeling helpless, confused and frustrated.” said Kamil Jagodzinski, VP of Customer Care at TravelPerk. “When disruption occurs it’s key that our customers feel supported by being quick and efficient. Our data shows that despite technological advances, only 10% of travelers want help from a chatbot over a human customer care agent. At TravelPerk, we’ve integrated AI into our customer service teams so we can leverage this technology to handle double the volume of customer queries versus 2023, with the same number of human agents – ensuring customers are able to speak with a human when something unexpected unfolds.” In today’s business environment, the ability to navigate travel disruptions effectively can make the difference between securing or losing crucial business opportunities as TravelPerk customers need to travel for a variety of reasons whether it’s to fix a wind turbine or sign the dotted line. Commenting on this,Yasmine Bratt, Chief Revenue Officer at TravelPerk said: “With 85% of people saying that disruptions impacted their productivity, the missed opportunity for businesses can be significant. Businesses that enable their employees to be more flexible, by arriving the night before or taking the most efficient mode of transport, can more effectively mitigate the impact of disruption – both on their employees and their bottom line.” Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

Russian Airlines Forced to Ground 34 of Their 66 Airbus Jets,https://eturbonews.com/russian-airlines-forced-to-ground-34-of-their-66-airbus-jets/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 21, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Russia’s commercial air carriers have suspended operations of more than a half of their Airbus fleets, grounding 34 out of 66 A320neo and A321neo aircraft currently in the country. According to local media reports, the grounding was mainly due to the impact of Western sanctions imposed on Russia. In recent months, Airbus A320neo and A321neo jets have been withdrawn from service owing to challenges in obtaining necessary parts, which has hindered the proper maintenance of their engines, the reports say. Airbus Neo aircraft are fitted with engines produced by the American company Pratt & Whitney, while others are equipped with LEAP-1A engines manufactured by the Franco-American company CFM International. Russia: Aviation Safety Not Affected by Western Sanctions Prior to the imposition of sanctions by the United States, the European Union, and their allies in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia was a significant market for aircraft lessors. These lessors acquired jets from Boeing and Airbus and subsequently leased them to domestic airlines. However, the extensive sanctions have effectively blocked Russian operators from obtaining spare parts and maintenance services from Western suppliers. Media reports indicate that certain aircraft are expected to remain grounded until the onset of the next high season, at which point many planes may be able to resume some operations. Nonetheless, half of the grounded Airbus aircraft are at risk of not returning to service, the reports add. S7, the third largest airline in Russia, has encountered the most substantial challenges. The airline has reportedly grounded 31 out of its 39 A320neo and A321neo aircraft, which are aged between three and seven years. Additionally, the engines on more than 20 of S7’s Airbus planes are said to have reached the end of their operational life. Russia’s largest airline, Aeroflot, has reportedly been compelled to ground two of its nine Airbus Neo jets, while Ural Airlines has suspended one of its eleven aircraft. Additionally, seven more jets in Russia are currently in operation by Nordwind Airlines, Smartavia, and North-West Aircompany. The A320neo and A321neo aircraft represent approximately 10% of the foreign-manufactured planes within Russia’s aviation fleet, which could lead to a disruption of 10-15% in passenger air traffic starting in 2025 and continuing thereafter. According to sources, Russia may be forced to begin the mass retirement of Airbus planes in its possession by 2026 if viable maintenance solutions do not become available.

Saudi Arabia and Tanzania Set for Closer Business Cooperation,https://eturbonews.com/saudi-arabia-and-tanzania-set-for-closer-business-cooperation/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 20, 2024",N/A,Apolinari Tairo - eTN Tanzania,"Saudi Arabia and Tanzania are collaborating closely to enhance business opportunities by leveraging the current economic diversification initiatives of the Kingdom. The Tanzania and Saudi Arabia Business Forum is set to occur in Riyadh next month, with the aim of attracting more investors from Saudi Arabia. Tourism is identified as a primary sector for investment that Tanzania is keen to develop with support from the Kingdom. The Business Forum is scheduled to be held in Riyadh from December 17 to 21, focusing on attracting Saudi investments to Tanzania. Tanzania aims to gain insights from Saudi Arabia in the oil and gas sector, capitalizing on its status as one of the world’s leading oil producers. Recent reports from the Tanzania Investment Center (TIC) indicate that the Tanzania Embassy in Saudi Arabia has been actively coordinating the upcoming Business Forum in collaboration with companies from the Kingdom. Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan visited Saudi Arabia in November 2023, where she engaged in discussions with Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, in Riyadh. The dialogue between the two leaders focused on fostering investment and business opportunities between Tanzania and Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom has opened its market to Tanzanian fresh and processed meat, catering to a demand exceeding 700,000 tonnes annually. Under the leadership of Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Tanzania has established a productive partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the global stage. In 2019, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia launched its national tourism strategy, aiming to attract 100 million tourists by 2030. Saudi Arabia Strengthens Tourism Education and Training Through its Vision 2030 initiative, the Kingdom seeks to enhance its governmental institutions, achieving numerous objectives both nationally and internationally. This progress underscores the Kingdom’s commitment to improving its tourism sector and drawing in international visitors. Between January and July of this year, Saudi Arabia welcomed 4.2 million visitors seeking entertainment and leisure, marking a 25 percent increase compared to the previous year. Tourism statistics indicate a rapid growth in travel and tourism, propelled by Vision 2030, which aims to establish the Kingdom as a global tourism destination. The UN World Tourism Barometer has identified the Kingdom as the fastest-growing G20 nation in terms of international arrivals and tourism revenue. New tourist attractions, such as the Diriyah Gate project, along with significant investments in luxury resorts along the Red Sea coast, have drawn increased investments in tourism and attracted visitors from various countries worldwide. In March of last year, Saudia airline initiated direct flights between Jeddah and Dar es Salaam to facilitate travel between the Kingdom and Tanzania, primarily catering to business travelers and tourists. Hajj pilgrims traveling from Tanzania to the Kingdom during the annual Umrah and Hajj pilgrimage represent the largest segment of air travelers utilizing the airline’s package fares. The introduction of Saudia’s scheduled flights to Tanzania is part of the airline’s strategic initiative to connect the world to the Kingdom while maximizing the use of new aircraft being integrated into its operations, as stated by the airline.

Suspended Direct Flights Between India and China May Resume Soon,https://eturbonews.com/suspended-direct-flights-between-india-and-china-may-resume-soon/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 20, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"During their meeting at the G20 summit in Brazil, the foreign ministers of China and India have engaged in discussions regarding the potential resumption of direct flights between their nations, a development anticipated to enhance trade, tourism, and cultural interactions. Direct flights between India and China, along with the pilgrimage, were halted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and have yet to be reinstated, even though the restrictions were lifted several years ago. The ministers acknowledged that the disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Himalayan border region where military confrontations occurred in 2020, has played a significant role in maintaining peace and stability. This ministerial dialogue followed an agreement reached several weeks prior between New Delhi and Beijing to address a protracted border dispute that has persisted for four years. According to a statement released by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, the discussions centered on the future trajectory of India-China relations. Among the initiatives considered were the revival of pilgrimages to the sacred sites of Mansarovar Lake and Mount Kailash in Tibet, data sharing concerning trans-border rivers, media exchanges, and the reinstatement of direct flights between India and China. China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, emphasized that the productive discussions between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the recent event in Kazan, Russia, and the subsequent “restart” of bilateral relations align with the “fundamental interests of the two peoples, the expectations of Global South nations, and the appropriate trajectory of history.” Wang underscored the importance of both parties adhering to the agreements made by their national leaders, honoring each other’s core interests, and fostering mutual trust through ongoing dialogue and communication. The truce between India and China was declared following more than 30 rounds of discussions at both military and diplomatic levels. During the G20 meeting, both parties underscored their dedication to a multipolar world and recognized the significance of India-China relations for the global community, particularly for the Global South. Jaishankar emphasized New Delhi’s strong commitment to a multipolar Asia. Wang highlighted that as neighboring nations and major developing economies, China and India share more common interests than differences. He urged both countries to perceive each other’s development as an opportunity and to collaborate towards achieving mutual development.

Nevertheless, some beaches throughout the United States harbor unexpected hazards that could turn a delightful holiday into a treacherous experience. A visit to the beach ought to be a pleasurable experience for all guests, regardless of the season. While the prospect of shark attacks is alarming, they pose a lesser threat compared to hurricanes. Hurricanes generate hazardous rip currents and storm surges, significantly increasing the overall danger for beach visitors. It is essential for beachgoers to utilize this information to adopt appropriate safety measures during their beach outings. A recent study assessed multiple factors, such as hurricanes, shark attacks, and fatalities in the surf zone, ultimately assigning each beach a score out of 100 to identify the most hazardous beaches in America, providing intriguing insights into the most common risks associated with the top-rated beaches. New Smyrna Beach, Florida, holds the distinction of being America’s most perilous beach, achieving a score of 76.04. This beach is particularly susceptible to hurricanes due to its geographical position along the Florida coastline and has the highest incidence of shark attacks in the nation, with a total of 185 recorded incidents, far exceeding Daytona Beach, which follows in second place with 141 attacks. In the second position is Panama City Beach, Florida, which has a score of 67.75. This beach has recorded 32 fatalities in the surf zone, the highest number across all U.S. beaches, primarily attributed to rip currents. Daytona Beach, Florida, ranks third with a score of 60.01. It experiences significant shark attacks and surf zone fatalities, with 18 and 44 incidents, respectively. Finally, Miami Beach, Florida, occupies the fourth spot with a score of 47.78. Like the other Florida beaches mentioned, Miami Beach is also prone to hurricanes, having encountered a total of 124 hurricanes throughout its history. Cocoa Beach, Florida, ranks fifth with a final score of 46.35. Notably, among the 26 documented shark attacks at Cocoa Beach, there have been no fatalities. Ormond Beach, Florida, occupies the sixth position with a final score of 41.57. All six surf zone fatalities recorded at Ormond Beach were attributed to rip currents. Seventh on the list is Ponce Inlet, Florida, which has a final score of 41.54. Located in Volusia County, Ponce Inlet has witnessed a significant number of shark attacks, totaling 34, yet it has only recorded two surf zone fatalities. Indialantic Beach, Florida, is in eighth place with a final score of 40.30. This beach has experienced six surf zone fatalities alongside eight recorded shark attacks. Melbourne Beach, Florida, ranks ninth with a final score of 40.92. There have been 19 recorded shark attacks at Melbourne Beach, the majority of which are related to surfing activities. Completing the list of the top ten most dangerous beaches in America is Miramar Beach, Florida, with a final score of 40.63.

Squaw-Free: California Removes Offensive Word from the Maps,https://eturbonews.com/squaw-free-california-removes-offensive-word-from-the-maps/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 18, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Government officials in California announced that the term “squaw” widely recognized as a derogatory term that disrespects Native American women, will be eliminated from the names of numerous locations throughout the US state. It is believed that the term “squaw” originated from the Algonquin word for “woman” used by Native Americans, but it has since been officially recognized as an offensive and derogatory term. According to a press release from the California Natural Resources Agency , the term will be removed from over 30 geographic features and sites within the state, following the approval of new names by a committee assigned to review them. “The removal of this term is an essential measure in acknowledging the persistent trauma and oppression experienced by Native communities,” the agency stated. “This initiative, which has received commendation from tribal, local, and state leaders, is regarded as a significant advancement towards a more inclusive California.” The document also states: “The term ‘squaw’ is a racist and derogatory term that has historically been used as an offensive ethnic, racial, and sexist slur, particularly for indigenous women.” The new names will be selected by a committee with the aim to “honor and recognize” the indigenous tribes and languages that are native to the area, as outlined in the bill, in accordance with legislation initially endorsed by California Governor Gavin Newsom in 2022. The new designations are scheduled to be implemented by January 1, 2025, as part of a national initiative aimed at eliminating offensive terminology from geographic features. Last year, the United States undertook the renaming of several military installations that were named after Confederate officers, a decision stemming from a prolonged initiative by Congress following the Black Lives Matter protests. Although recently, while campaigning for the presidency, President-elect Donald Trump pledged to revert the name of Fort Liberty to its original designation, Fort Bragg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A6obWFDB28 Visit Native California, Discover Wonders of Golden State Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel
Bankrupt: Spirit Airlines Files for Chapter 11 Protection,https://eturbonews.com/bankrupt-spirit-airlines-files-for-chapter-11-protection/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 18, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Spirit Airlines, a low-cost carrier providing services to 47 domestic destinations within the United States and 28 international destinations, which encompass airports located in the Caribbean and Latin America, has announced today its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US Bankruptcy Court located in the Southern District of New York. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is often utilized by businesses as a means to facilitate financial restructuring. As per the court documents, Spirit has reported its estimated assets and liabilities to fall between $1 billion and $10 billion. The carrier announced that it will also be removed from the New York Stock Exchange following the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing. In a statement to the stock market, Spirit Airlines stated that it has reached a prearranged agreement with bondholders, which encompasses $300 million in financing to ensure its continued operation. The carrier intends to emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings by Q1 of 2025. Spirit’s action was apparently triggered by substantial financial difficulties stemming from increasing losses and upcoming debt maturities, following its recent unsuccessful merger attempts with Frontier Airlines and JetBlue Airways —resulting in significant challenges for the ultra-low-cost carrier due to ongoing quarterly losses. The company’s efforts to generate much needed funds, which included workforce reductions and the sale of aircraft, have also failed. Spirit Airlines Unexpected decision to furlough Pilots and defer Airbus Orders Spirit Airlines last recorded a profit in the year 2019. Spirit Airlines has become the first large American air carrier to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since American Airlines did so more than a decade ago. THE OPEN LETTER SENT BY SPIRIT AIRLINES TO ITS CUSTOMERS: “We are writing to let you know about a proactive step Spirit has taken to position the company for success. Spirit has entered into an agreement with our bondholders that is expected to reduce our total debt, provide increased financial flexibility, position Spirit for long-term success and accelerate investments providing Guests with enhanced travel experiences and greater value. Part of this financial restructuring includes filing a “prearranged” chapter 11. The most important thing to know is that you can continue to book and fly now and in the future. We also want to assure you: You can use all tickets, credits and loyalty points as normal. You can continue to benefit from our Free Spirit loyalty program, Saver$ Club perks and credit card terms. Our amazing Team Members are here to offer you excellent service and an elevated experience. We expect to complete this process in the first quarter of 2025 and emerge even better positioned to deliver the best value in the sky. Other airlines that are operating successfully today have undertaken a similar process. For more information about our financial restructuring, please visit www.SpiritGoForward.com. We’re grateful you continue to choose Spirit for your travel needs. As we head into the holiday season and beyond, we look forward to welcoming you on board again soon.” * Spirit Airlines, Inc., stylized as spirit, is an ultra-low cost airline headquartered in Dania Beach, Florida, in the Miami metropolitan area. Spirit operates scheduled flights throughout the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Spirit was the seventh largest passenger carrier in North America as of 2023, as well as the largest ultra-low-cost carrier in North America.

Additionally, the court has ratified the distribution process and designated A.B. Data as the claims administrator. WHAT IS THE CLASS ACTION ABOUT? The plaintiff contended that WestJet imposed a fee for the first checked baggage in violation of a provision included in WestJet’s tariff during the relevant class period. The class action has reached a settlement, with WestJet denying any liability. AM I IN THE SETTLEMENT CLASS? Individuals worldwide who paid a fee for their first checked baggage on a WestJet flight booked directly with WestJet, with tickets issued on or after September 15, 2014, for travel between October 29, 2014, and July 29, 2017 for domestic flights within Canada, or tickets issued on or after November 3, 2015, for travel between January 6, 2016, and February 27, 2019, for international flights, and whose itineraries were booked under a tariff that included the provision for free baggage, are included in the settlement class. IS IT POSSIBLE TO SUBMIT A CLAIM AT THIS TIME? The claims period is established from November 11, 2024, to February 10, 2025. WHAT STEPS SHOULD I FOLLOW TO SUBMIT CLAIM? To take advantage of the settlement, it is necessary to file a claim. There are three (3) methods available for submitting a claim: If you have received an email notification from the Claims Administrator regarding this settlement, you may utilize the Unique ID and PIN provided in that email to submit a prepopulated claim. You can also file the claim form electronically, accompanied by proof of class membership. Alternatively, you may download a paper claim form and send it to the Claims Administrator along with your proof of class membership. All claim forms should be directed to the WestJet Settlement Administrator, c/o A.B. Data, Ltd., P.O. Box 173103, Milwaukee, WI 53217. WHAT CAN I RECEIVE FROM THE SETTLEMENT? The settlement comprises WestJet Travel Bank credits totaling CAD 12,500,000, prior to the deduction of class counsel fees, administrative expenses, reasonable disbursements, and an honorarium for the plaintiff. WestJet will disburse cash for class counsel fees, which amount to one-third of the settlement, along with disbursements and the plaintiff’s honorarium of CAD 1,500. After these deductions, the remaining funds will be allocated on a pro rata basis as credits to the WestJet Travel Bank accounts of class members who submit a claim, in accordance with the court-approved claims protocol. The claims period is set from November 11, 2024, to February 10, 2025. The protocol stipulates a different distribution formula for claims submitted before or after July 6, 2017, due to possible limitation periods. The WestJet Travel Bank credits can be utilized for WestJet flights within a 24-month period, with no blackout dates. If not redeemed within this timeframe, the credits will expire. While the credits are non-transferable, they may be used to book flights for another individual. The amount distributed on a pro rata basis will be contingent upon the number of eligible claims received, thus affecting the claims rate. Class counsel anticipates that the pro rata distribution for each class member will range from CAD 10 to CAD 20, based on an estimated claims rate of 5%. It is important to note that this is merely an estimate and not a definitive distribution amount. WILL I AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVE THE WESTJET TRAVEL BANK CREDITS? No, it is necessary for you to submit a claim form through one of the three methods outlined above. Please refer to “How can I make a claim” for further details.

The survey reported that during the 2023/2024 cruise year, a total of 1,426,485 cruise passengers arrived in Jamaica aboard cruise ships and an estimated 1,158,240 passengers disembarked to visit the island. In total, passengers spent roughly $136.7 million USD through including accommodations, food and beverage, local goods and shore excursions. “We have seen tremendous growth in our cruise tourism sector,” said Hon. Edmund Bartlett, Minister of Tourism, Jamaica. “In 2023, we welcomed 1.26 million cruise passenger arrivals which was 48.3% above 2022 figures. To keep up with demand, we work diligently to ensure our ports and services remain updated so cruise lines, crew members and passengers have an outstanding experience from arrival to departure – including the enjoyment of our famous beaches, historical sites and adventure experiences in between.” Onshore, passengers spent 71% of their money on excursions, watches and jewelry.

Essential Office Disinfection Tips for Travel Agencies,https://eturbonews.com/essential-office-disinfection-tips-for-travel-agencies/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 15, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"A travel agency office sees a significant number of visitors, increasing the risk of germ transmission. Keeping this environment clean requires thorough office disinfection and specific measures to reduce health risks. Read on to discover practical steps you can take to create a safer, healthier office space for both staff and visitors. Prioritize High-traffic Areas and Common Surfaces In a travel agency office, high-traffic zones like reception areas, consultation rooms, and shared spaces see constant movement and frequent surface contact. Maintaining clean, disinfected surfaces in these areas is essential for keeping the office environment healthy. To ensure these spaces remain safe, the following are key cleaning and disinfecting practices for high-traffic and high-touch areas: Identify key high-touch surfaces: Look for surfaces that receive constant contact, such as door handles, light switches, and reception counters. Disinfect these surfaces multiple times each day to reduce germ buildup effectively. Use EPA-approved disinfectants : Choose products from the EPA’s ‘List N,’ which are proven effective against viruses. These disinfectants provide a reliable option for managing germ-prone areas in high-traffic office spaces. Consider electrostatic spraying for larger spaces: Electrostatic sprayers evenly distribute disinfectants across surfaces, ensuring full coverage. This approach is especially helpful in larger or more complex office layouts, where manual application might miss certain spots. For agencies seeking thorough cleaning solutions, Fort Worth commercial cleaning services or other local commercial cleaning companies provide specialized office disinfection. These services help ensure that all high-touch areas are consistently and effectively sanitized. Use Professional Disinfection Services for Thorough Cleaning For a comprehensive and effective office cleaning, professional disinfection services offer a reliable solution, especially in areas that benefit from specialized expertise and equipment. Here are some ways professional services contribute to a cleaner, safer workspace: Schedule regular deep cleaning: Professional cleaners can manage deep cleaning of office spaces on a regular schedule. This covers surfaces like office furniture, carpets, and hidden spots that accumulate dust and germs, creating a healthier environment. Ensure compliance with product instructions: Professional cleaners are trained to follow specific manufacturer instructions for disinfectant use. This ensures that disinfectants are applied safely and effectively, maximizing their efficacy without damaging surfaces. Disinfect soft surfaces properly: Soft surfaces like upholstered chairs, carpets, and drapes require particular attention. Professional services have the tools and techniques to properly disinfect these areas, reducing allergens and ensuring thorough sanitization. Incorporating professional cleaning services into the routine helps agencies maintain a well-sanitized environment. This approach promotes a healthier workspace for both employees and clients. Implement Routine Cleaning and Disinfection Schedules Establishing a routine for cleaning and disinfection is essential for keeping the office consistently sanitized. A well-planned schedule minimizes germ buildup and maintains a healthier environment. Here are a few key practices to include in your routine: Daily surface disinfection: Set up a daily plan for cleaning high-touch surfaces like phones, desks, and shared office equipment. Frequent disinfection of these surfaces reduces the risk of germ transfer, especially in busy areas. Weekly deep cleaning and sanitization: While daily tasks handle immediate needs, weekly deep cleaning goes further by targeting less obvious areas such as vents, furniture, and fixtures. This thorough clean helps remove dust, allergens, and germs that may build up over time. Regular hand sanitizer refills: Keep hand sanitizer stations stocked throughout the office. Having sanitizers readily available encourages employees and visitors to maintain good hand hygiene , which supports overall cleanliness. A structured cleaning schedule helps ensure your office remains clean, safe, and welcoming for everyone. Reinforce Workplace Hygiene and Employee Health Measures Prioritizing employee health and hygiene practices is essential for a clean, safe workspace in a travel agency. To help foster a healthy environment, the following measures are recommended: Promote regular hand sanitizing: Encourage employees to sanitize their hands frequently, particularly after interacting with clients or shared office equipment. Ensure hand sanitizers and wipes are conveniently placed around high-traffic areas, making it easy for staff to follow good hygiene practices. Flexible sick leave policies: Allow flexibility for employees to stay home if they feel unwell, preventing the potential spread of illness within the office. Clear sick leave guidelines that support employee health help reduce work absences and contribute to a healthier office overall. Encourage personal workspace cleanliness: Remind employees to regularly disinfect their personal items, such as keyboards, phones, and pens. Personal workspace hygiene is often overlooked but helps maintain an overall sanitary office environment. Implementing these practices ensures the office remains in the best working condition , fostering a healthier and more productive atmosphere for both employees and clients. Final Thoughts A clean and safe office is vital for a travel agency’s success. Regular cleaning, professional disinfection, and strong hygiene practices create a healthier environment. Prioritizing these measures helps reduce health risks and ensures a welcoming space for both employees and clients. A commitment to cleanliness boosts employee well-being and builds trust with visitors.

Travel Software Solutions to Enhance the Post-Pandemic Travel Experience,https://eturbonews.com/travel-software-solutions-to-enhance-the-post-pandemic-travel-experience/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 15, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"Since the situation started to change, so did the expectations of the travelers, where health, safety, and frictionless experiences hold greater value. In meeting these new demands, the integration of technology will be key, availing solutions that improve safety, as well as overall satisfaction by the traveler. Contactless Technology for Safe and Seamless Experiences With hygiene and efficiency becoming the top concerns for travelers, there has been a surge in the adoption and integration of contactless technologies into travel software . The need for touchless solutions developed quite rapidly since travelers sought ways of reducing physical interactions and possible health risks which many traditional processes of travel normally would present. Examples of such innovations include touchless check-ins, where guests do not have to stop at the front desk and can go right to their rooms without unnecessary contact. Many chains introduce mobile room keys: using their smartphones, customers can unlock the doors — a feature that makes life easier and safer. Another element of this transition is contactless payments, which allow travelers to make purchases without touching payment terminals. For example, a report done by NMI in 2023 projects that the global contactless payment market will top $10 trillion by 2027, as awareness of hygiene has been raised since the pandemic started. With these technologies set to gradually become the norm in the travel industry, the risk of contagion will be greatly reduced, thereby giving confidence to travelers in undertaking journeys. It thus follows that tourism will increasingly fall into a phase of better health protocols and delivery mechanisms. AI-Driven Virtual Assistants and Customer Support Artificial intelligence is surely changing customer support for good in the travel industry. AI-powered tools, such as chatbots and virtual assistants serving instant information to travelers and helping them in real time, make any query they have instantaneous without needing any human contact. For instance, AI-driven chatbots like IndiGo’s “6Eskai” and Air India’s “AI.g” have significantly improved the efficiency in addressing a host of customer queries on anything related to flight changes, cancellations, and even restrictions on travel. These chatbots will not only make this operation seamless, but also ensure passengers are kept informed about the latest information 24/7. The advantages of AI in customer service go beyond immediate problem resolution. By automating routine inquiries, travel booking software platforms enable airlines and hospitality services to allocate human resources to more complex inquiries, thereby enhancing the overall customer experience. AI systems excel at analyzing trends and customer interactions, allowing travel firms to develop services based on predictive insights. This results in quicker resolution times and a more engaging travel experience, effectively meeting modern travelers’ demands for speed and efficiency. Remote Work Tools for the Digital Nomad Boom The pandemic catalyzed a huge surge in remote work, and this is apparently meant to be followed by a corresponding increase in “work-from-anywhere” setups among travelers, especially among the digital nomads. This crowd has shown readiness towards merging work with leisure, and so the need for complementing their lifestyle by the place of accommodation. This development sees a number of hotels introducing special coworking spaces that provide the right atmosphere in which to work while on the move. For example, Hilton and Hyatt have already embraced the trend by placing coworking concepts at the forefront of hotel design, with comfortable workstations offering reliable Wi-Fi and ergonomic setups reminiscent of a traveling professional’s needs. Secondly, Wi-Fi boosters in rental homes are key to ensuring that digital nomads have the kind of connectivity they need. This demand for longer-stay, tailored bookings has affected how hotels reassess their offering to highlight features appealing to work and leisure. Indeed, from dedicated meeting space to quiet work periods during the day, packaging in free add-ons like printing and Wi-Fi is standard. This development manifold caters not only to the needs of a growing remote workforce but also lures new streams of revenue into the hotels attracting these travelers in search of functional yet inviting work environments. According to recent surveys, there are more than 17 million American workers identifying themselves as digital nomads, an increase of 131% from 2019, further cementing the importance of adapting to this lifestyle. Big Data and Predictive Analytics for Personalization Personalization has emerged as an intrinsic part of data analytics in the travel industry, helping companies to understand the constantly evolving customer preferences and needs. It could be anything-from internal to external data, which can be used to build experiences keeping the traveler’s needs in mind. For example, predictive analytics enable firms to calibrate services and offerings to match up with emerging trends and historical data of travel behavior. These could, in turn, result in highly customized travel packages to meet the special interests of the customer and a manifold increase in engagement. Furthermore, big data-driven dynamic pricing models empower tour operator software providers to align offerings with demand fluctuations and customer behavior patterns. Incorporating these analytics into pricing strategies allows businesses to boost profitability while providing value to travelers. For example, airlines and hotels can use forecasted demand-based on a blend of internal bookings and external market data-to optimize price in such a way that prices reflect real-time capacity and marketplace realities. With this increased personalization comes customer satisfaction, which leads to the growth of brand loyalty and repeat business from travelers who value customized experiences tailor-made for their specific preferences and budgetary needs. Final Thoughts Contactless technology, processes for health verification, and AI-driven customer support are some of the new additions that are gaining more traction in the transformation of travel in these post-pandemic times.​ As working remotely gives rise to the newest wave of travelers desiring flexible accommodations, innovation in hospitality has stopped being optional but has become an imperative. Big data furthers personalization, whereby businesses can tailor specific preferences and demands for travelers. Embracing these technological advances will enable the travel industry to sort out much of the modern travel complexity and satisfy the needs of customers for safe and enjoyable travel.

Bordeaux Dethrones Paris as France’s Most Romantic Destination,https://eturbonews.com/bordeaux-dethrones-paris-as-frances-most-romantic-destination/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 15, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"When travelers envision a romantic getaway in France, Paris, often referred to as the ‘City of Love,’ typically emerges as the primary choice. Nevertheless, studies indicate that lesser-known cities can be equally, if not more, suitable for a romantic retreat. These destinations offer a variety of upscale hotels and dining establishments where couples can relax and savor their holiday in a more tranquil setting. With a reduced influx of tourists, couples can fully immerse themselves in the ambiance and discover local attractions without the inconvenience of long queues, ensuring that their photographs remain free of unfamiliar faces in the background. Travel experts conducted an analysis utilizing data from TripAdvisor and Google Keyword Planner to pinpoint the premier romantic Christmas getaway locations in France. The researchers evaluated the 30 largest cities in France , taking into account various factors such as the volume of monthly Google searches, the proximity of the nearest airport to the city center, and whether the destination is situated along the coast. Additionally, the study examined the availability of attractions tailored for couples, the presence of luxury accommodations featuring romantic descriptors in guest reviews like ‘intimate’ and ‘romantic,’ as well as the existence of Michelin-starred and romantic dining establishments with reviews that include terms such as ‘dreamy’ and ‘secluded’ for each city. To maintain equity among cities of varying sizes, the findings were normalized per 100,000 residents, thereby showcasing the most appealing locations for couples and offering a curated list of essential sites for memorable experiences. The analysis identified Bordeaux as the top romantic getaway in France. Renowned as the wine capital, Bordeaux garners an impressive 40.62 Google searches per 100,000 individuals each month. The city is situated a mere five kilometers (3.1 miles) from the nearest airport. Although it is not a coastal destination, Bordeaux boasts 42 attractions specifically designed for couples and 46 luxury or romantic hotels, with guest reviews frequently mentioning terms such as ‘romantic,’ ‘intimate,’ and ‘passionate.’ With an impressive density of 98 Michelin-starred or romantic restaurants for every 100,000 residents, it stands out as an exceptional choice for couples in search of a delightful and memorable experience. Bordeaux and Its Wines Change… Slowly Paris is recognized as the second most romantic getaway in France. This beloved destination attracts couples, generating an average of 120.02 Google searches per 100,000 individuals each month. The city’s close proximity to the nearest airport—merely one kilometer from the center—ensures that couples can easily access their accommodations. Although Paris is situated inland and does not feature a beach, its renowned status as a center for art, gastronomy, and culture more than makes up for this absence. Couples can explore 28 tourist attractions for every 100,000 people, stay in 33 luxury or romantic hotels, and dine at 93 Michelin-starred or romantic restaurants, with reviews often describing these experiences as ‘dreamy’ or ‘secluded.’ Aix-en-Provence, a picturesque university town in southern France, ranks third among the most romantic getaway destinations. Despite being relatively obscure among newlyweds, with no recorded monthly Google searches, it remains a hidden treasure. The closest airport is situated 15 kilometers from the city center, resulting in a somewhat extended travel time. Although Aix-en-Provence is located inland, it provides numerous attractions for couples, featuring 31 tourist sites, 53 luxury or romantic hotels, and 77 Michelin-starred or romantic dining establishments per 100,000 residents. According to reviews and statistics, this often-overlooked destination merits greater recognition among couples. Nice, the second-largest city along the French Mediterranean coast, holds the fourth position. With an average of 59.06 monthly Google searches per 100,000 individuals, it is a favored and accessible location, just two kilometers from the nearest airport. As a seaside town, Nice is perfect for couples who appreciate beach relaxation. Furthermore, it boasts 35 tourist attractions, 21 luxury or romantic hotels, and 73 Michelin-starred or romantic restaurants per 100,000 residents, establishing it as a premier option for couples in search of coastal allure and abundant amenities. Montpellier is ranked as the fifth most romantic getaway in France. Despite recording only 1.34 Google searches per 100,000 people each month, this southern French city should not be disregarded by couples. The location near the Mediterranean Sea enhances its attractiveness as a beach destination, with the closest airport situated merely three kilometers away, ensuring convenient access. For couples, Montpellier boasts 13 tourist attractions, 17 luxury or romantic hotels, and 60 Michelin-starred or romantic dining establishments for every 100,000 residents, rendering it a highly romantic yet often overlooked option for couples.

Entries were, in turn, ‘playful’ or ‘captivating,’ yet also reflective of the demands of socially conscious travelers.” Human connection was a theme throughout the entries. One judge noted that the stories are a “ “reminder of why we travel.” In helping audiences meet people, explore places and learn history, travel writers explain people live in and perceive our world. The Gold Award for the Lowell Thomas Travel Journalist of the Year went to Natalie Compton from The Washington Post. “This entry is a tribute to the power of imagination in finding unique stories around the globe and in our own backyard,” the judges said. “First-person point of view is used in advancing the story, not showing off….This is an entry that offers a lot of lessons for terrific storytelling. Amanda Finnegan, editor of By the Way and the travel editorial team at The Washington Post won gold for Newspaper Travel Coverage. The judges said: “The Post finds pockets of inventive story ideas and takes them in unexpected directions. The stories are stylish as well as original, taking travel writing up a notch by surprising the audience and then adding layers of research and detail to put together refreshing and satisfying reads.” AFAR Magazine, led by editor-in-chief, Julia Cosgrove, won Gold for Travel Magazines for a second year in a row. “AFAR goes the distance through storytelling that toggles between practical and transcendent, whether guiding readers along the Rhine River or coaxing them into ‘Travel that Changes You,’ the judges said. “A blend of lush photography, stunning design and intelligent reportage makes AFAR a one-stop shop for modern – and socially conscious – travelers.” Outside Magazine with Mary Turner, director of travel coverage, won the Gold for Travel Coverage in General Magazines.

Their itinerary included exploring the islands of Mahé, Praslin, and La Digue, capturing Seychelles’ natural beauty and diverse tourism offerings. Mr. Innasithamby’s visit was the fruit of highly successful engagements between Mrs. Amia Jovanovic-Desir, the Tourism Seychelles Manager for Sri Lanka, and key media figures during the Seychelles Chef Project in Colombo in August, facilitated by Mr. Dougie Douglas, a representative of Air Seychelles. Speaking about the project, Mrs. Amia Jovanovic-Desir highlighted Tourism Seychelles’ strategy to leverage influential personalities to promote the islands across various markets. “ Tourism Seychelles ’ decision to invite Mr. Innasithamby stems from his wide-reaching influence and strong online presence, which we believe will significantly boost the visibility of Seychelles in Sri Lanka and beyond. As a leading media figure with a multi-faceted career spanning television, radio, print, and social media, Mr. Innasithamby is known for his engaging style and ability to captivate a diverse audience,” said Mrs. Amia Jovanovic-Desir. She added that the collaboration is expected to yield a high return on investment by showcasing Seychelles’ unique tourism offerings—from various accommodations and cultural landmarks to the stunning natural beauty of the archipelago. The Sri Lankan celebrity features in several popular shows, including A Date with Danu on Hi TV and the pioneering English-language Café Colombo, which have garnered widespread acclaim.

Singapore is Enhancing Sustainable Tourism Programs,https://eturbonews.com/singapore-is-enhancing-sustainable-tourism-programs/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 14, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"The Singapore Tourism Board ( STB ) has introduced two innovative initiatives aimed at enhancing sustainable tourism and supporting the Singapore Green Plan 2030. The first initiative is the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) Attraction Criteria, which represents the first global standard specifically tailored for attractions. The second initiative is the MICE Venue Sustainability Playbook, a detailed guide designed to improve environmentally friendly practices within the Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, and Exhibitions (MICE) sector. These initiatives were announced by Mr. Alvin Tan, Minister of State for Trade & Industry, and Culture, Community and Youth, during the GSTC Global Sustainable Tourism Conference, which Singapore is hosting for the first time. This conference serves as a platform for organizations and individuals dedicated to sustainable travel and tourism to share ideas, promote collaboration, and establish partnerships. Ms. Ong Huey Hong, STB’s Chief Sustainability Officer, remarked, “These initiatives are crucial for positioning Singapore as a premier sustainable urban destination and showcasing our dedication to sustainability. By creating world-class standards and equipping the industry with practical resources, we are not only advancing our tourism sector but also contributing to global sustainability efforts in tourism.” The GSTC Attraction Criteria functions as the international benchmark for sustainability in travel and tourism. It is utilized for educational purposes, policy formulation for businesses, and evaluation by organizations and government agencies, as well as serving as a foundation for certification. Developed with the support of STB, the GSTC Attraction Criteria aims to establish a universal sustainability standard for attractions, providing a shared understanding of sustainable practices globally. Attractions can anticipate the opportunity to apply for certification in early 2026, following the onboarding and GSTC accreditation of certification bodies. Mr. Randy Durband, the CEO of GSTC, stated that the introduction of the GSTC Attraction Criteria represents a significant advancement, resulting from 14 months of collaborative effort and commitment. He expressed gratitude for the contributions made by STB, which have been instrumental in this achievement. He encouraged all stakeholders to seize this opportunity to guide the attractions sector towards a more sustainable future. In 2023, Singapore took the lead by conducting a national Carbon and Waste Baseline exercise for the MICE industry, positioning itself among the first nations globally to undertake such an initiative. Recognizing the critical role of venues within the MICE ecosystem, this exercise compiled sustainability data from six dedicated MICE venues in Singapore, concentrating on energy, water, and waste metrics. The resulting baseline offers a reliable set of emissions data that can be tracked annually, enabling STB and the industry to enhance their management of waste and carbon emissions. The findings indicate that the average carbon emissions associated with MICE venues per attendee is 14.13 kg of carbon dioxide, with energy consumption constituting 94% of these emissions. Utilizing the insights derived from this exercise, STB has developed the MICE Venue Sustainability Playbook, aimed at assisting MICE venues in managing their carbon emissions. This Playbook provides actionable recommendations for improving energy efficiency, waste management, and water conservation, aligning with the venues’ sustainability goals. Additionally, the Playbook includes a decarbonization framework, showcases best practices from both local and international purpose-built MICE venues, and consolidates government support schemes to promote decarbonization across Singapore’s MICE venues. In May of this year, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) introduced its Legacy Toolkit, aimed at helping meeting planners and business event organizers gain a deeper understanding of legacy and impact, while also guiding them in creating their own initiatives. Utilizing this toolkit, STB will implement a pilot incentive program during the GSTC Global Sustainable Tourism Conference in Singapore. To further demonstrate STB’s dedication to minimizing carbon emissions at business events, attendees at the GSTC Conference are encouraged to offset the carbon emissions resulting from their air travel by acquiring high-quality carbon credits through a reputable offset project. Participants who engage in this initiative will receive a pre-loaded value card, which can be utilized for public transportation in Singapore. This program seeks to raise awareness regarding the carbon emissions associated with air travel and to motivate delegates to take responsibility for their own emissions, ultimately promoting a more environmentally friendly and sustainable experience throughout their journey.

As Sex Crimes Spike Berlin Mulls ‘Rape-Proof’ Subways Cars,https://eturbonews.com/as-sex-crimes-spike-berlin-mulls-rape-proof-subways-cars/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 14, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"German politician of Alliance 90/The Greens, MP Antje Kapek, has proposed the launch of women-only metro cars on Berlin’s public transportation system in response to an increase in violent assaults. The politician, who serves as the transport spokesperson for the Greens, referenced a particularly alarming incident from earlier this year, in which a 33-year-old assailant attacked and raped a 63-year-old woman on the subway. Following the assault, the perpetrator left the scene without incident and was apprehended only several weeks later. Kapek emphasized that women are often subjected to violence and therefore require enhanced protection. According to police statistics, nearly 4,200 violent crimes were reported on Berlin’s metro, trains, and buses last year. However, in the first nine months of this year, that figure has surged to over 5,600, with nearly 300 of these incidents classified as sexual offenses. The train cars designated for women will be situated either immediately behind the driver or at the rear of the train, as explained by Kapek. The proposal also encompasses enhanced video surveillance and the installation of emergency call boxes on platforms. The German MP referenced Japan as a pertinent example, noting that the majority of train lines in the metropolitan regions of the country feature women-only cars during peak hours. This initiative was implemented approximately two decades ago to address the issue of groping incidents involving female passengers. Comparable initiatives are also in place in the Cairo Metro in Egypt, the Rio de Janeiro Metro in Brazil, as well as on train systems in India, the Philippines, and Indonesia. In response to an inquiry, the Berlin transport company BVG asserted that the current safety measures are adequate, which include alarm buttons within train cars, information boxes, and the presence of police officers at each station. Right-wing politician Rolf Wiedenhaupt, representing the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is the fifth-largest party in the national parliament, described the proposal as “absurd.” “Security is not achieved by categorizing victims, but rather through decisive action against offenders and expedited legal proceedings,” Wiedenhaupt stated, as reported by Der Spiegel. German tabloid newspaper Bild conducted interviews with women of various ages to assess their views on the proposal. The respondents expressed strong support for the concept and indicated that they would utilize a ladies-only compartment. Many acknowledged feeling unsafe while using public transportation and reported experiences of unwanted attention, including staring and groping. However, one 83-year-old interviewee raised concerns about the feasibility of enforcing such a measure and questioned whether men would adhere to it.

The company projects that air cargo traffic will rise by an average of 4% annually until 2043. These forecasts are detailed in Boeing ‘s 2024 World Air Cargo Forecast (WACF), a biennial report that provides an overview and long-term perspective on the air cargo industry. Darren Hulst, Boeing’s vice president of Commercial Marketing, stated that air cargo, recognized as the fastest and most dependable method for transporting goods, has experienced consistent growth that has reinstated the industry to its long-term trajectory. He emphasized that numerous factors will contribute to the ongoing demand for freighters in the next two decades, such as the expansion of emerging markets and the global increase in manufacturing and e-commerce. The global air cargo fleet is forecast to rise to 3,900 airplanes by 2043, a two-thirds increase from 2,340 freighters in 2023. Driven by demand in high-growth Asian markets, the large widebody freighter fleet will nearly double. Nearly half of production and conversion deliveries will replace retiring freighters with more capable and fuel-efficient models — due to recent market needs, many older jets remain in service. Regional movers: East and South Asian markets will see the highest traffic growth per year, driven by expanding economies and consumer demand. With the Asia-Pacific fleet expected to nearly triple, carriers in that region will require the most deliveries (980), followed closely by North America (955). These two regions will account for more than two-thirds of global deliveries. India’s domestic air cargo market will nearly quadruple as express and e-commerce networks expand. Express carriers forecast: Express carriers will serve one quarter of the air cargo market (up from current 18%). Express carriers are poised to grow faster than the industry average due to an increasing role in e-commerce distribution and the expansion of express networks in emerging markets.

This mission is focused on reinforcing ties with major partners, including Jeju Air, Jin Air, Korean Air, and t’way, to offer incentives for additional flights while preserving the existing airline schedule. “Korean visitors are essential to our business revenue. Currently we have four airlines actively serving this market and the current seat capacity is about 60% of our pre pandemic numbers from Korea.

Quinata. Guam delegation meets with Jeju Air CEO & CRF Kim, Ebae along with other Jeju Air management. In addition to the airline talks, a significant highlight of the Korea mission was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between GVB and Shinhan Card, one of Korea’s largest financial service providers.

Guam Pay, offering their cardholders exclusive discounts and added value for their Guam vacations. “Increasing visitor spend improves the value chain that our visitors and locals have come to enjoy,” noted President Gutierrez. Recent data from Shinhan Card indicates that cardholder spending on Guam tripled in 2024 compared to the same promotional period in 2019.

Additionally, the United Nations has halted flights to the Caribbean nation. Since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021, Haiti has spiraled into chaos and violence. A Kenyan police mission, supported by the UN, has struggled to contain the armed gangs that now dominate much of the capital. The United Nations (UN) also announced the suspension of flights to Haiti due to security concerns, which will significantly restrict the delivery of humanitarian aid and the movement of humanitarian personnel into the country. The announcement followed the issuance of a notice by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to all airlines operating in the United States, declaring Haiti temporarily inaccessible due to the incident that occurred on Monday at Toussaint Louverture International Airport. A Spirit Airlines flight en route from Florida was struck by gunfire while approaching the airport, and a JetBlue aircraft traveling from New York also sustained damage. In response, Spirit Airlines, JetBlue, and American Airlines promptly canceled several of their flights to Haiti. Meanwhile, Sunrise Airways, a Haiti-based carrier, reported that its services to Florida in the US and other Caribbean locations continue to operate without disruption. US Embassy in Haiti Tells Citizens to Leave ASAP This marks the second instance this year in which air travel to and from Haiti has been hindered by armed gangs. Airports in both Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien experienced closures lasting nearly three months following a series of shootings in late February, during which the gangs sought the removal of acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry. The latest attacks coincided with the interim council governing Haiti dismissing acting Prime Minister Gary Conille and installing his successor, Alix Didier Fils-Aime. Neither individual has yet addressed the shootings or the subsequent flight restrictions. “This was an act of terrorism; the nations that are monitoring and assisting Haiti should classify these armed gangs as terrorist organizations,” stated Luis Abinader, the president of the neighboring Dominican Republic, during a press conference on Monday. The two nations share the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean.

The figures reveal a steady upward trend in visitor arrivals, with numbers consistently rising since mid-October. Following a slow performance in the second and third quarter, arrivals rebounded robustly from week 40 (ending October 6), with weekly counts surpassing those of 2023 and 2022. Notably, the week ending October 20 saw over 8,000 arrivals, and visitor numbers for week 44 were even 3% higher than the same period in our best year, 2019. European travelers account for 73% of the total visitor numbers for the year to date, highlighting Seychelles’ enduring appeal in Europe and reinforcing its status as a highly desirable destination in these markets. Three key European markets remain central to this success, including Germany, leading with 50,194 visitors, accounting for 17% of total arrivals, followed by France with 36,895 visitors and Russia with 27,955, making up a combined 39% of all arrivals. Commenting on the increase in visitor numbers, Mrs. Sherin Francis, Principal Secretary for Tourism, attributes the rise in visitor numbers to a mix of factors. “The current numbers are very encouraging and reflect the combined efforts of the Seychelles Tourism Department and its partners in boosting the country’s visibility, accessibility, and appeal. Access to better connectivity has notably contributed to this growth, especially towards end of September, with weekend arrivals often reaching pre-COVID levels. This shows the potential impact of improved air access to our islands. Overall, this growth highlights the resilience and adaptability of our local tourism industry as we continue to draw travelers in a rapidly changing global landscape.” Building on this positive momentum, Seychelles continues to attract other key markets, with the UAE and USA showing strong performance compared to last year.

Americans Warned: Post-Election Move to Canada Will Cost You,https://eturbonews.com/americans-warned-post-election-move-to-canada-will-cost-you/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 12, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"A recent study has identified which major Canadian cities present the most cost-effective opportunities for potential homebuyers considering a move from the United States. In the wake of Donald Trump’s recent electoral success, there has been a notable increase in interest among Americans in relocating to Canada, as evidenced by a significant rise in Google searches for terms such as ‘Move to Canada’ and ‘Canada work visa.’ This trend indicates a heightened interest among U.S. citizens in exploring relocation possibilities. Skip Forward: 4-Year Cruise Offers Americans Escape from Trump The research evaluated rental affordability and the duration necessary to accumulate a home deposit. Analysts utilized average one-bedroom rental prices and annual income statistics from Statistics Canada to determine the proportion of income allocated to rent. For assessing home prices, the study relied on data from the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) to estimate the time required to save for a 10% deposit on an average-priced home. The researchers employed the 50-30-20 budgeting rule to calculate monthly savings and ranked the cities based on the time needed to save. Quebec City stands out as the premier destination for potential homebuyers who wish to rent while accumulating savings for a future home. The typical monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment is approximately $911 CAD, contrasted with an average annual salary of $50,500. This results in residents allocating merely 21.65% of their yearly income towards rent, rendering it an optimal location for financial savings. This figure is 37% lower than the national average, where Canadians typically devote 34.5% of their annual income to rental expenses. Montreal is identified as the second most favorable city for those renting while planning to purchase a home. The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom unit is $960, with an average annual income of $43,800. Consequently, tenants allocate 26.3% of their income to rent. St. John’s, NL is recognized as the third most advantageous city for renting while saving for home ownership. The average monthly rent stands at $904, and with an annual income of $39,100, residents spend only 27.74% of their earnings on a one-bedroom apartment. Toronto ranks as the least favorable major city for potential homebuyers seeking rental options, with an average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment set at $1,691. Considering that the average annual income for residents in Toronto is $41,800, this results in renters allocating 48.55% of their income towards housing costs, which significantly limits their ability to save. Vancouver follows closely as the second least favorable city for renting while attempting to save for a home. The average cost for a one-bedroom rental is $1,697. With an average annual income of $44,200, residents in Vancouver dedicate 46.07% of their earnings to rent. Halifax, Nova Scotia, is identified as the third least affordable city for renters, with an average monthly rent of $1,322 for a one-bedroom unit. Given the average annual income of $38,700, tenants in Halifax spend 40.99% of their income on rent. It is essential to assess not only the most and least favorable cities for renting while saving for a home but also the duration required to accumulate a home deposit in each major city. Utilizing the 50-30-20 budgeting principle based on monthly income, researchers have calculated the time prospective home buyers will need to save for a 10% deposit on a property. The findings indicate that Quebec City stands out as the most advantageous location for prospective home buyers. It not only features the most economical rental prices but also enables individuals to save for a home deposit in the shortest time frame. With an average annual income of $50,500 and an average home price of $343,200, allocating 20% of income monthly results in a savings period of approximately 40.77 months, which is just under three and a half years, to secure a 10% deposit. Regina, Saskatchewan, ranks as the second most favorable city for accumulating a home deposit. With an average annual income of $43,900 and a home price of $310,223, it takes around 42.39 months, or roughly three years and six months, to save for a 10% deposit. Winnipeg, Manitoba, is positioned third in terms of the quickest time required to save for a down payment. Given an average annual income of $42,300 and an average home price of $346,654, potential homeowners will need approximately 49.17 months, which translates to just over four years, to save 20% as a down payment. Vancouver ranks as the least favorable major Canadian city for home buyers, characterized by exorbitant rental prices and the most prolonged duration required to accumulate a 10% home deposit. With an average annual income of $44,200 and a typical home price of $1,193,808, it would take approximately 162.05 months—equivalent to around 13 years and six months—to save for a deposit, assuming that 20% of income is allocated each month. This duration is nearly a decade longer than that required in Quebec City. Toronto follows as the city with the second-longest duration needed to save for a home deposit. With an average income of $41,800 and an average home price of $1,104,592, residents would need about 158.55 months to save for a 10% deposit. This translates to roughly 13 years and two months, provided that individuals save 20% of their monthly earnings. The Lower B.C. Mainland ranks third among major cities with the slowest home deposit saving time. With an average annual income of $43,900 and an average home price of $1,128,008, prospective home buyers would require 154.16 months to save for a deposit. This duration equates to approximately 12 years and ten months if future homeowners set aside 20% of their monthly income.

Orders Pour in for China’s New AS700 Airship,https://eturbonews.com/orders-pour-in-for-chinas-new-as700-airship/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 12, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"China’s AS700 civil manned airship, developed independently, has secured an additional 10 purchase orders and is now poised for commercial operations, as announced by its developer, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) , today. With these new orders, the total number of AS700 bookings has reached 23, as reported during the 15th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, commonly referred to as Airshow China, held in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province. Each airship is priced at 24.99 million yuan (approximately US$3.47 million). The signing ceremony on Tuesday also included the confirmation of 164 intended orders for the aircraft. China Test Flies Airship for Tourism Sector, Urban Services The AS700 is a single-capsule manned airship with a maximum flight range of 700 kilometers and an endurance of 10 hours. It is designed to reach a maximum speed of 100 kilometers per hour and can accommodate up to 10 individuals, including the pilot. The inaugural AS700 airship was delivered in September of this year. As a novel category of low-altitude aviation technology, this manned airship, produced in China, is expected to significantly contribute to the development of the low-altitude economy in the country, according to AVIC. The manufacturer states that passengers on the AS700 will have the opportunity to appreciate stunning aerial views through its expansive panoramic side windows. With its moderate cruising speed, the airship aims to offer tourists a flight experience akin to “floating on clouds.” The development team plans to prioritize low-altitude sightseeing tourism in the future, while also recognizing the considerable potential for expansion into various other sectors, including aerial advertising, urban security, aviation exploration, and emergency rescue. The AVIC AS700-class of airships (otherwise known as the Xiangyun-class which translates to auspicious clouds) is a class of non-rigid airships built for commercial and tourism use. It is developed and built by AVIC as its first attempt in the civilian airship market. The AS700 is characterized by its ellipsoid hull and a rigid tail structure arranged in an “X” configuration, diverging from the conventional “+” layout. This design is recognized as a lightweight and economically viable capsule-shaped airship. The tail incorporates flight control surfaces that facilitate steering ease. The airship’s gondola features a non-retractable single-point landing gear positioned at the rear, which establishes a center of gravity that enhances the AS700’s stability during ground transport. As a non-rigid airship, the AS700’s envelope consists of a single lift gas cell constructed from a multi-layer fabric-film laminate composite. This material ensures the necessary strength, minimizes helium leakage, and offers resistance to tearing and adverse weather conditions. Inside the outer envelope, the airship is equipped with ballonets for pitch control. These ballonets are crafted from lightweight polymer cells and include helium safety valves to prevent over-pressurization, ensuring a safe landing in case of a failure in the maneuvering system. The AS700 is equipped with state-of-the-art fly-by-wire flight control systems and advanced avionics. The gondola is spacious enough to accommodate a single pilot and nine passengers, with options for a food service area and a washroom. The large windows are designed to be operable during flight. Pilot controls are managed through a side stick controller, simplifying operation. Additionally, the airship can be configured for unmanned operations. The AS700 was designed largely for civilian usage, specifically, in the tourism sector. The project first began in August 2018. According to the project manager of the AS700, Du Wei, he stated that the airship’s market is built in line with China’s consumption transformation and upgrading needs. Specifically for low-altitude sightseeing and tourism as well as potentially expanding the ship’s services to emergency rescue, urban public services and other fields.

On November 7, the day following Trump’s declaration as the winner of the 2024 presidential election, Villa Vie Residences introduced its Skip Forward package. This package is part of the company’s Tour La Vie program, which has an annual starting price of approximately $40,000. With more than 425 ports in 140 countries, each voyage offers a unique chance to explore the world from the comfort of their floating residence, featuring constantly evolving vistas. Participants have the option to embark on their personalized journey at any port throughout the ongoing global expedition, which lasts for a duration of up to four years. The three-year expedition is titled “Everywhere but Home.” According to the company’s website, the four-year package is priced at $159,999 per person for a double room, or $255,999 for a single-occupancy cabin. The experience referred to as an escape from reality, the “Skip Forward” cruise includes visits to 140 countries on all seven continents on the Villa Vie Odyssey. The trip is designed for four years, but there is an option to purchase a “Midterm Elections” package with a return to the United States by the fall of 2026. The cost of the “Skip Forward” cruise starts at $255,900 for a single cabin with an “all-inclusive option” for four years, a double room costs $319,000.

The vessel is scheduled to visit all seven continents, explore 13 World Wonders, and discover over 100 tropical islands throughout its journey. Odyssey will dock in various ports for durations ranging from two to five days. The cruise ship offers fitness rooms, spa treatments, and alcoholic beverages during lunch and dinner. Although this unusual cruise, introduced following the 2024 presidential election, has become further evidence that the Trump presidency evokes mixed emotions and encourages people to seek an “outlet” from political reality, Villa Vie Residences claims that it is not “politically motivated” and is appropriate for all travelers, irrespective of their political views, with an emphasis on global exploration and cultural immersion.

Approximately 60 additional victims of the explosion sustained injuries in the incident, with several in critical condition. The explosion took place near a ticket booth on the platform just as two trains were about to arrive, including the Jaffar Express en route to Peshawar, according to railway officials. At the time of the blast, a considerable number of passengers were present on the platform, and local authorities in Quetta anticipate that the death toll may increase. Online footage revealed a platform strewn with debris and luggage, including items that seem to be military backpacks. Pakistani officials have declared an emergency, dispatched the rescue teams to the blast site, where they have commenced operations. Several wounded victims have been transported to Quetta’s Civil Hospital and local medical facility. Security personnel have secured the site. Quetta’s Senior Superintendent of Police Operations, Mohammad Baloch, stated that the authorities are examining the claim made by the BLA. According to him, the incident appeared to resemble a suicide blast; however, it remains premature to draw definitive conclusions. He also mentioned that a bomb disposal unit has reached the location and is actively engaged in assessing the nature of the explosion. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has already issued a statement asserting its responsibility for the deadly explosion. In a statement shared on social media, the organization indicated that a suicide bomber aimed at a unit of the Pakistan Army, which they alleged was traveling on the Jaffar Express train to Peshawar after finishing a course at an infantry school. Pakistan has banned BLA in 2009 in accordance with the nation’s anti-terrorism legislation. Balochistan, the largest yet least populated province of Pakistan, is home to significant mining operations and the ethnic Baloch minority. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has persistently pursued independence for the province from the central authority in Islamabad. The insurgents regularly target police and military personnel in the region, as well as foreign nationals, particularly Chinese individuals involved in infrastructure projects under Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative.

This marks an increase of 1.3 million trips compared to the previous year. During this period, the number of tourist trips to Russia surged to 1.2 million, a substantial rise from 429,100 in the corresponding period of 2023, according to FSB statistics. The data also indicates a rising interest among Chinese tourists, who accounted for 731,800 trips from January to September, nearly seven times the 105,800 trips recorded in the same period last year. Analysts have observed that while there is an increasing interest among Chinese travelers to visit Russia, the numbers have not yet returned to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, when 1.2 million Chinese tourists traveled to Russia within a span of three quarters. Prior to the global COVID-19 pandemic, China was the primary source of foreign tourists in Russia, with over 80% of these visitors traveling in groups under a visa-free arrangement. The rise in tourist arrivals from China has been attributed to the easing of visa regulations and the introduction of online visa services, according to Intourist travel company. Presently, travelers from China represent 65% of the total international tourist traffic to Russia. Due to Western sanctions imposed on Moscow in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there has been a significant reduction in flights between Russia and EU nations. Consequently, the Russian tourism sector has redirected its attention towards Asia and the Middle East. Additionally, researchers have pointed out an increasing potential tourist interest in Russia from other regions, including Iran, Türkiye, the UAE, and India. Notably, there has been a nearly twelvefold increase in tourist arrivals from Saudi Arabia, with 39,100 visitors recorded in the first nine months of the year, compared to just 3,300 during the same timeframe last year.

However, when it comes to securing a fair contract, Allegiant is seeking concessions,” stated Captain David Mercado, a pilot with Allegiant and a member of Local 2118. “We are frustrated, and this vote to authorize a strike reflects that sentiment.” Teamsters Extend Allegiant Air Contract The Teamsters are advocating for compensation that aligns with industry standards and enhancements to scheduling practices. Allegiant pilots are among the most overworked and undercompensated in the airline sector. During negotiations, the airline has sought to obtain concessions in return for long-overdue salary increases. Last year, Allegiant achieved a record revenue of $2.5 billion. In 2019, the airline secured a $25 million annual agreement for the naming rights to the home stadium of the Las Vegas Raiders. On November 12, Teamsters pilots are scheduled to conduct a practice picket outside Allegiant’s corporate headquarters in Las Vegas, as part of a series of direct actions initiated by Allegiant pilots at various airline hubs across the country. “We will not compromise our quality of life for an inadequate pay increase,” stated Captain Michael Nichols, a pilot with Allegiant Teamsters. “This strike vote concerns the sustainability of Allegiant and the communities we serve – without a contract that meets industry standards, we will struggle to attract and retain pilots.” Currently, Teamsters Local 2118 and Allegiant Air are engaged in mediation sessions facilitated by the federal National Mediation Board (NMB). According to the Railway Labor Act, the Teamsters have the option to request a release from the NMB, which may result in a 30-day cooling-off period, potentially leading to an unannounced work stoppage. Teamsters Local 2118 represents a dedicated group of 1,300 Allegiant Air pilots across the nation.

Pedro Homar from VisitPalma, told attendees he was optimistic that overtourism could be addressed through various technology-enabled practical measures, but the main driver is political. “Tourism has become the common enemy for inhabitants,” he said. “And when we solve issues around mobility, housing, schools, there won’t be as big an emphasis on overtourism.” He also admitted that attempts to address overtourism through pricing had failed. Price was the focus of a session which speculated on whether we have reached the end of the era of low-cost travel. The consensus was that price is still a motivating factor for many travelers but perceived value for money is pivotal, and that personalization was an effective way to create that perception. Sarah Sheppard from tech giant Sabre noted: “The priority is more value than price sensitivity, that’s being driven by traveler expectations.” Costs to businesses, rather the cost to customers, was a feature of a session about hospitality tech. Tim Hentschel from Hotelplanner talked about its new Hotel Assistant, a voice-enabled AI agent which can talk to travelers and book rooms. “It costs about $2 a call compared with $6 for our human agents, but it’s only converting at about a quarter the rate.” He added, “The product has only been live for a week or so, “and it will get better because AI is always learning, always getting better.” Elsewhere, bloggers and influencers were also upbeat, within reason, about the current limitations that generative AI has. Filipe Morato Gomes, who set up Alma de Viajante 20 years ago, recently created a website exclusively using AI generated content. “I generated 30-40 posts,” he said, “and in the first few days, the articles ranked, but then they disappeared completely.” TV travel shows are still a part of the marketing mix for travel companies. In her closing keynote, Katherine Ryan, who co-presented a Channel 4 travel show, also posts travel content onto her social channels. “I’m certainly not a travel influencer,” she said, “but I make myself into one. I love to document the trips I take.” Ryan was perhaps the only person at the event to mention a travel trend which emerged on social media this year. Sitting in silence and without distractions – such as in-flight movies, reading, listening to podcasts on long flights – became a TikTok trend known as “rawdogging.” “That’s something for the alpha males,” she said. “When I fly, I don’t drink, I don’t eat, I just sleep.” WTM Day 2 Focus on Sustainability, Diversity and Digital Marketing Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

The underlying message, represented in the theme “The Advocate as Catalyst,” is that the tourism industry, and destination organizations in particular, need to be recognized as catalysts for community vitality and an essential public good rather than simply sales and marketing organizations, as in the past. The 2024 Advocacy Summit continued to advance DI’s work to build awareness that the days when destination organizations were measured primarily on number of visitors or “heads in beds” is over and destination promotion today must be regarded as essential to a community’s vitality, on par with education, healthcare, emergency response, utilities and other public services. “Destination organizations are redesigning themselves to be both visitor and resident facing organizations with community-wide social goals alongside traditional sales and marketing goals.” Jack Johnson, DI Chief Advocacy Officer, added: “In today’s globalized competitive environment, they are an essential community asset responsible for programs that promote their community as an attractive travel destination and enhance its image as a dynamic place to visit, live, work and invest. What makes these organizations essential is their unique destination knowledge, brand management savvy and promotional expertise – all of which not only attract visitors but contribute to a community’s social and economic vitality.” At the summit, DI elaborated on its latest industry brief, A Catalyst for Community Vitality: Defining the 21st Century Destination Organization , which more clearly defines the 21st century destination organization through the lens of purpose, mission and impact. The brief is intended for destination organization leaders as well as elected officials, public policy experts and media who are involved in the travel and tourism sector. The brief also is available on the new Destination Effect website, created by DI in partnership with Tempest, as an open resource to educate key stakeholders on the important role of destination organizations and their impact on local communities. The website will be expanded in coming months to include case studies and additional resources. DI also released an updated 2024 Tourism Lexicon across four countries: the United States, Australia, United Kingdom and Canada (including French Canadian). The Tourism Lexicon aims to provide destination organization leaders with a tactical communication tool to address the shifting political landscape and highlight the need that destination promotion is for the well-being of every person in a community. Other topics explored during the summit include the record number of elections taking place around the world in 2024 and 2025 and their potential impact on the travel and tourism industry; societal issues and how they are perceived can impact travel decisions about destinations; and use of visitor “personas” to integrate emotional resonance with logical KPIs and provide a more comprehensive framework for evaluating the work of destination organizations. DI’s annual Advocacy Summit gathers leaders from across its 750 destination organization members to provide updates and engage in conversation about key developments in the sector and emerging trends. Almost 200 participants from around the globe attended this year’s summit, which highlighted essential resources and tools funded by the Destinations International Foundation to tackle unique challenges with data, advocacy resources and insights for the travel and tourism industry. The 2025 Advocacy Summit will take place October 21-23, 2025, in Sacramento, CA.

This regulation, commonly referred to as the “burqa ban,” received public approval in a national referendum conducted in 2021. The Federal Council, Switzerland’s highest executive body, established the implementation date for the ban during yesterday’s meeting. According to the government’s statement, individuals who cover their faces in public across the nation will face penalties of up to 1,000 Swiss francs ($1,141). The prohibition encompasses Muslim attire, specifically the burqa and niqab, as well as ski masks and bandanas utilized by demonstrators. Law banning burqas and niqabs in public comes into force in the Netherlands According to the government, the ban does not extend to airplanes, diplomatic and consular facilities, or places of worship. Additionally, face coverings are allowed for health, safety, weather conditions, and local customs, as well as for artistic performances and advertising, as stated in the announcement. The March 2021 referendum was initiated by a popular movement advocating for the ban on face coverings. The proposal received approval from 51.2% of Swiss voters and was subsequently enacted by the parliament in September 2023. The initiative was supported by Swiss People’s Party, which is the largest faction in parliament. The Swiss government expressed opposition to the proposed measure, deeming it excessive and contending that the ban could negatively impact tourism. According to the Associated Press, the majority of Muslim women who don veils in Switzerland are visitors from Persian Gulf nations. Muslim organizations within Switzerland also denounced the ban. As reported by Switzerland’s Federal Statistics Office (FSO), among the permanent resident population aged 15 and older, which is approximately 7.5 million, 5.7% identify as Muslim. Similar prohibitions on the burqa, a full-body garment with mesh covering the eyes, and the niqab, a face veil with an opening for the eyes, are enforced in several countries, including France, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain.

The Summit, which took place on day two of World Travel Market London, and which was run in association with the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UN Tourism) and the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) , was moderated by BBC News Chief Presenter Geeta Guru Murthy. Jonathan Heastie, Portfolio Director, World Travel Market, set the scene in his introduction, observing that “AI has the power to transform tourism as we know it. It will enhance the experience for travelers and improve processes for businesses, but we need to think about addressing the ethical considerations.” Ethical considerations will become more intense as AI continues to grow, and the industry is contributing to the discussion at the highest level. Natalia Bayona, Executive Director, UN Tourism, told the packed room that UN Tourism has been working with major travel businesses such as booking.com, Expedia and JTB to devise a set of AI guidelines for governments. The results will be published in January 2025. However, creating a globally consistent regulatory landscape for AI is challenging, ministers agreed. Nikolina Brnjac from the European Parliament reminded the room that the European Union passed the AI Act this August, the world’s first-ever legal framework on AI. She said that Europe intends to be the global leader on regulating AI. However, there are many challenges ahead when it comes the guardrails around AI, even with legislation in place. Sherif Fathy, Head of Tourism and Antiquities, Egypt, pointed out that “governments hate it when they are forced to change the regulations consistently, so you need experts. You will need technicians in the legal team to monitor the developments of AI and make sure the regulations keep changing accordingly or consequently.” Another potential challenge was identified by Tonci Glavina, Minister for Tourism and Sport, Croatia. “To use AI properly, you need strong data,” he said, adding, “without that, it can go in the wrong direction, get out of hand.” Glavina’s comments around data integrity apply to all sectors. Christina Garcia Frasco, Secretary of Tourism, Philippines, noted that the country had set up a center for AI research and development earlier this year. “The focus initially is on sustainable agriculture, disaster resilience and urban planning,” she said, “all of which is linked to the continuing success of our tourism industry.” Despite the issues, the transformative power of AI is already evident, and one recurring theme across the two-hour session was the many and varied use cases and business cases to which AI can be applied. Julia Simpson, President and CEO, WTTC, referred to Hilton’s AI-powered “Green Breakfast Initiative” which reduced food waste by 62% across the 13 hotels that were part of the pilot. “Imagine if this became an industry standard and we could help smaller businesses adopt this too,” she said. “Just think of the impact. It can help drive the sustainable change we all need by leveraging the technology we already have available.” Another recurring theme was the balance between AI and the human component of tourism. Sultan M Almusallam, Deputy Minister of International Affairs, Saudi Arabia, noted that the Kingdom was “still figuring out how we can use [AI]…but we have agreed one principle: digitize the necessary, humanize the unnecessary.” He offered an example: “If you have a digitized hotel now, you won’t be able to interact with the people who are serving coffee or helping you with concierge services. Knowing the stories of people creates unforgettable experiences.” Other guests tended to agree, although digitization through AI can contribute in many ways to a better experience for the traveler. Haris Theoharis, a member of the Parliament of Greece, said: “The centre of the experience is the human element, and this will never change. But today, queues are part of the experience. If we can manage them better through AI, we can remove one of the elements that have the potential actually destroy the experience.” Other examples of how AI can help enhance the travel experience were shared by Nabeela Farida Koromah Tunis, minister of tourism for Sierra Leone. She enthused about how AI tools are already not only supporting conservation efforts at attractions such as the Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary but also supporting the country’s move towards sustainable and regenerative tourism. Her counterpart from Zimbabwe, Barbara Rowdzi, also framed AI as a tool by which the destination can preserve and enhance its tourism cornerstones – heritage and wildlife. As well as tapping AI to help conservation efforts, AI is also being used to train and educate tour guides.

Africa Emerges as Prime Destination for Sustainable Tourism Investments,https://eturbonews.com/africa-emerges-as-prime-destination-for-sustainable-tourism-investments/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 6, 2024",N/A,Apolinari Tairo - eTN Tanzania,"The African continent has been rated a Prime Destination for Sustainable Tourism Investments at the International Tourism and Investment Conference (ITIC) Global Tourism Investment Summit 2024 held at the World Travel Market (WTM) in London on Monday this week. The Executive Chairman of the African Tourism Board (ATB) Mr. Cuthbert Ncube stressed at the Summit, the significance of the three ESG pillars in addressing the unique challenges the region faces, such as climate change, socio-economic disparities, and governance issues. Mr. Ncube pointed out the considerable opportunities available for sustainable tourism development, which can benefit both local communities and the environment simultaneously. A prominent case study featured was Malawi, which has made impressive strides in boosting its global tourism appeal. The Malawian government announced the elimination of visa requirements for citizens from 79 countries and extended the validity of multiple-entry visas. The Malawian government’s commitment to making access easier for international visitors is viewed as a strategic effort to increase the country’s allure as a destination for both tourism and investment. The African Tourism Board (ATB) has praised this initiative, recognizing its potential to elevate Malawi’s standing in the global tourism arena, Mr. Ncube said. Malawian Minister for Tourism Vera Kamtukule had presented various investment projects at the ITIC Global Tourism Investment Summit 2024 targeting creating new pathways for economic growth and cultural exchange programs for Malawi tourism development. She emphasized the Malawi government’s commitment to balancing these opportunities with sustainable practices and infrastructure development, ensuring that the benefits of tourism were enduring and equitable. Malawi government’s initiative is currently encompassing North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Oceania as the key nations targeted to enhance tourism and investment prospects in Malawi, she said. Summit panelists and executives noted: Emphasis on sustainable tourism investment was not merely a fleeting trend but an essential strategy for Africa’s future, promising to strengthen the continent’s position as a leading destination for global tourism investment. The 2024 WTM in London will serve as a pivotal stage for Africa to present its unique tourism potential to a global audience, fostering networking, deal-making, and industry-wide engagement. The Africa Hall was set to become a focal point of WTM, with representatives from over 30 nations showcasing their distinct travel assets and tourist products, the WTM said through its media report. From the pristine beaches of the Seychelles to the famed safaris of Tanzania and Kenya, Africa’s extensive range of cultural, historical, and natural attractions will be on display, said the WTM report. Participating countries span the continent, from established tourism leaders like South Africa, Morocco, and Egypt to emerging destinations including Sierra Leone, Cabo Verde and The Gambia. “Africa delegation brings forward a compelling vision of the continent’s potential, underscoring its vibrant diversity, strength, and capacity to enrich the world’s tourism landscape”, said the WTM report. WTM London offers invaluable opportunities to engage directly with Africa’s tourism decision-makers, highlighting prospects for investment across diverse sectors. With an emphasis on sustainable tourism, cultural heritage conservation, and destination growth, the African delegation aims to attract attention to the continent’s appeal for travelers seeking authentic, responsible tourism experiences. The global tourism marketing event has been rated an essential occasion for investors, tour operators, and industry professionals interested in Africa’s future within the global tourism arena.

"WTM Day 2 Focus on Sustainability, Diversity and Digital Marketing",https://eturbonews.com/wtm-day-2-focus-on-sustainability-diversity-and-digital-marketing/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 6, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"Speakers at WTM London’s first Regenerative Tourism Summit said the travel and tourism sector needs to see a “paradigm shift”. Tina O’Dwyer, WTM London’s Sustainability Advisor, asked delegates: “Are we brave enough to leave behind a paradigm that has worked well for us in the past?” Anna Pollock, Founder of Conscious Travel, highlighted warnings from the World Trade Organisation of a “polycrisis” – a cluster of global risks, including the climate crisis, adding: “Sustainability is not enough.” Other speakers showcased how regenerative tourism is helping revive and support destinations, including peat bogs in Ireland, Loch Ness, Majorca and Flanders. Sustainability was also a major theme for the Greek National Tourism Organisation (GNTO). Andreas Fiorentinos, GNTO Secretary General, said the country is poised for another record setting year in 2024, with projected arrivals reaching approximately 35 million tourists, and total revenue expected to rise by 10% to about €22 billion – “driven by a robust increase in international arrivals and a growing emphasis on sustainability”. He pointed to developments such as an eco-islands initiative in the Aegean and investment in other sectors such as mountain tourism, hiking trails and ski resorts to help spread tourist arrivals across the seasons. Developing accessible tourism facilities and activities “makes business sense”, delegates heard at the WTM diversity, equality, accessibility, inclusion and intersectionality (DEAI) summit. Ryan Smith, the founder of The Access Agency, said investing in the accessible sector can generate $13 for every dollar spent. He said the public and private sectors are developing more facilities for disabled travellers, ranging from hot air balloons with easy-access baskets to all-terrain wheelchairs. The DEAI summit also heard how focusing on employees’ strengths can pay dividends, during a discussion with Mark Julian Edwards, CEO of The Strengths Explorer. He said the attraction and retention of talent in the industry is the “number one hot topic”, adding: “If we have a culture where people feel included, they are going to give more. Jo Rzymowska, founder of Jovolution, outlined how she helped Celebrity Cruises to increase its ratio of female officers from 2% to 32%, and led a marketing project to create a photo library of real guests on cruises rather than stereotypical families. Digital marketing was another sector in the spotlight on day two. In a popular session entitled Digital Marketing Trends, Dan Christian, host of the popular Travel Trends podcast, highlighted social media search; hyper-personalisation with AI; the mainstream use of podcast marketing; short-form video’s dominance and the rise of purpose-driven marketing as issues to watch next year. Christian also commented: “Google are still generating 75% of their revenue from search and I think that’s going to be under siege. Referring to booking platforms, he predicted Booking.com would be able to integrate AI faster than its rivals. Concluding with tips for digital marketers he said it was most important to have an effective content strategy, to combine that with AI and to be strong on data analytics. Hannah Bennett, head of travel for TikTok, used WTM London to unveil a report with PhocusWire about TikTok’s growing influence on travel decisions, saying three in ten users are now actively searching the platform for travel content. Short-form video also now leads social media types for sales conversions among social media users, she added, with creators, followed by OTAs and hotel brands the most likely route. “The Tik Tok community as a whole has changed how they’ve used the app and also how they make decisions,” she said. The WTM StartUp Pitch Battle took place with a panel of judges headed by WTM’s technology advisor, Timothy O’Neil-Dunne. “I’ve seen lots of pitch competitions over the years and this is one of the strongest line-ups I’ve had to judge,” he said. He also noted that, of the six entrepreneurs pitching their business, five were female. The winner, appropriately, was Greether. Founded in 2021 by Vanessa Karel and based in San Francisco, the business is a marketplace designed to help solo female travellers explore the world safely. Female travellers can connect with verified women greeters in their chosen destination who can then personalise the trip according to the travellers’ interests. Finally, the power of networking was stressed in the ITT Future You session entitled 15 Years of Bridging the Gap Between Education and Industry. “A network is important, so you have lots of options to pivot into,” said Felix Ochefu, founder and CEO of Kahana, who said that one of his tech suppliers collapsed as he was about to launch his business. EasyJet Holidays’ senior strategy manager Louie Davis stressed the importance of thinking how you can add value when approaching networking, rather than seeing it as a transaction. He pointed out that newcomers to the industry still had useful authentic views to share. Jo Rzymowska, founder of Jovolution, said networking had enabled her to have a multi-faceted career changing job around every five years to cover all corners of the industry from car rental to theme parks to cruise. “It’s getting out of your comfort zone and having that mindset of flexibility and adaptability,” she advised.

WTM Explores Potential for Net Positive Tourism,https://eturbonews.com/wtm-explores-potential-for-net-positive-tourism/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 6, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"André Russ, vice president, business development and sales for EarthCheck said the industry needed to “take some decisive action on how we actually refine what is travel. Picking up the theme, global sustainability director Jessica Matthias from technology company Sabre pointed out visitor numbers had always been used as a benchmark for success. “We need to shift that narrative to look at how we are managing visitor impact. We need consistency on goals,” she said, adding there was “huge potential for technology to facilitate good travel.” Already Sabre has a Travel Impact Model displaying relative average emissions figures to help travellers choose between similar flights. It hopes this will become an industry standard. Technology was also a theme picked up by Peter Krueger, chief strategy officer and CEO, Holiday Experiences for TUI Group who outlined the successful introduction of solar panels across its own hotels in Turkey. This had not only had the positive impact of reducing emissions but also lowered the cost of energy from 12-15 cents an hour to 7cs. He pointed out the group had secured government buy in for permission to erect the solar panels and hook them up to the grid. Of the more global picture he commented: “What is holding us back right now is destination governments.” As part of the Travalyst coalition, Sabre is working with other travel companies, including its competitors, to bring consistent sustainability initiatives to the mainstream. Matthias said working with destination governments was the number one priority. Among existing destination initiatives, the session heard how the Japan National Tourism Organisation has shared community tourism successes to help other areas. It has also employed technology to enable tourists to see how busy popular sites are in real time, and to match those interested to voluntourism opportunities on farms. Ras Al Khaimah Tourism Development Authority told how a cross-border collaboration enabled it to encourage visitors to enter its larger neighbours at busy times to prevent overtourism. An Earthcheck partnership, through which it has earned silver certification, has meanwhile taught the destination how to make a double-digit reduction in hotels’ food waste.

Is Frictionless Travel Fiction?,https://eturbonews.com/is-frictionless-travel-fiction/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 6, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"The Technology Track, organised and moderated by Timothy O’Neil-Dunne from T2Impact and sponsored by trip.com Group, featured a dozen or so speakers and panellists from different geographies discussing “the frictionless future of travel”. Mark Lenahan, Head of Retailing Strategy, Travelport, started the sessions by sharing the feedback he’s received from customer focus groups over the years. He noted that travellers from different source markets have a different point of reference when it comes to their favourite e-commerce brands – outside of travel – to do business with. “But when I asked why, the answer is always the same,” he said, “Customers want things to be easy.” But in travel, he continued, we make things complicated. He identified two degrees of complexity: necessary complexity – government and regulatory requirements – and self-inflicted complexity – millions of fares, over-complicated product catalogues, too many booking categories Ian Tunnacliffe from T2RL expanded on this, adding in “the laws of physics” as another layer of complexity that technology providers have to consider, defining this as components of the aviation industry that are never going to go away. “Comparing the airline industry to Amazon is like chalk and cheese,” he explained. “But it’s not the technology that makes the industry complicated, it’s the underlying business processes that we need to rationalise.” The specific question about whether technology or processes are causing the complexity problems which lead to friction was a recurring theme. Lenahan used the example of how banking has changed for the better over the years as a result of digitisation, a point that was expanded upon in a session featuring execs from payment providers. James Lennon from Stripe noted how the payments industry has changed significantly over the past ten years, and that payments are now, or should be, as important as marketing and loyalty. Ease of payment is a prerequisite to frictionless travel, but a customer-centric payment process also inspires trust and positive word-of-mouth. He added that online travel is a highly competitive space and that if a customer is nervous around the security of the payments page, or if the site does not accept the customer’s payment method of choice, “there are tons of other travel companies out there who will. Lennon told sellers and suppliers that earning the trust of travellers meant more of them are likely to take up the flexible options which today’s payment technology offered, such as buy now pay later, pay by installment or through a plan. He noted that these options had a positive impact on conversion rates and basket value. On the same panel, Will Plummer, CEO & Co-Founder, Trust My Group, noted that “payments are often seen as the end of the funnel but trust in payments starts when the customer arrives at your web site”. Frictionlessness and trust are all essential aspects of any online travel business, but businesses need senior execs to see the value of investing in the technology to deliver these foundational principles. Keynote speaker Boon Sian Chai, Managing Director and Vice President, International Markets, Trip.com Group, shared with attendees the story of its highly successful Live Streaming product for the Chinese audience, the brainchild of the group’s co-founder and CEO James Liang. With C-suite buy-in baked in at source to this innovation, the group has now opened a dedicated centre in Bangkok to roll out Live Streaming to Asia-Pacific source markets. Customer-centricity, like frictionlessness and trust, are global considerations for travel brands, as evidenced by an around-the-world session which drew on the experience of regional OTAs – Almosafer from Saudi Arabia, GoNexus from Latin America and Travelstart from Africa. Qais Ammori, chief digital & technology officer for Almosafer, noted that demographics were driving its approach to ease of use. Around half of the population is less than 20 years old and therefore smartphone-native, which explains the OTA’s mobile-first approach. The Technology Track concluded with a debate between selected panellists, moderated by Phocuswire editor Linda Fox. The teams were nominally divided into those who thought travel technology was the cause of the complexity and those who disagreed. The audience was asked to vote at the end of the debate and the result – within acceptable margins of error – was 50/50. O-Neil Dunne concluded: “Neither the professionals nor the audience could agree whether technology is causing the friction. While the For motion nominally won the debate, it was not a decisive victory. “But the answer, ultimately, is meaningless. Consumers wont allow travel sellers to use ‘legacy tech stacks’ or ‘government regulations’ as an excuse for poor service. They expect as smooth and seamless search, shop, book and pay experience as they get with Amazon et al, however unrealistic that might be. Either way, It’s not going to be easy but we have to put the work in.” WTM: 2024 Greece Tourism Looks Set to Break Records Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel

Andreas Fiorentinos, Secretary General of the Greek National Tourism Organization, said: “2024 is a year of growth, sustainability and record-breaking expectation. Greece’s tourism sector is poised for another record setting year in 2024, with projected arrivals reaching approximately 35 million tourists, and total revenue expected to rise by 10% to about €22 billion. This is driven by a robust increase in international arrivals and a growing emphasis on sustainability.” Speaking at World Travel Market London , he said tourism accounts for more than 19% of GDP and creates over 800,000 jobs. “However, as we grow, we must also focus on sustaining our natural beauty, cultural heritage and social well-being,” he said. “These principles are woven into every initiative, every investment and every interaction, as we strive to create a tourism model that benefits visitors, residents and our country. Greece is entering a new era in its tourism industry, prioritizing sustainability and a people-focused approach.” He said EU finding is helping to modernize Greece’s infrastructure, making the destination more accessible to tourism all year round. “This approach not only eases seasonal pressure on popular destinations, but also expands economic opportunities for communities beyond the summer months,” he explained. Furthermore, an eco-islands initiative in the Aegean is developing solar energy, electric cars and digital innovation. Other sectors such as mountain tourism, hiking trails and ski resorts will be developed further to position Greece as a “more appealing year-round destination”. He added: “The UK is one of our top source markets, and we highly value our partnerships with tour operators, travel agents, media, airlines and travelers. “Together, we are working to expand seasonal flight schedules, create new, enriched travel packages and highlight exciting destinations across Greece. In 2024 we are already seeing a significant increase in tourism flow from the UK, with relevant increases in terms of revenue and arrivals. “Through collaborative efforts, we aim to keep Greece open to visitors nearly year-round, capitalizing on our mild climate and diverse offerings across all seasons. “We envision Greece as a beacon of sustainable tourism in the Mediterranean.” The GNTO and EasyJet holidays have agreed a partnership which will see the operator invest in Greek tourism development over the next four years. EasyJet’s in-house tour operator currently operates to 14 destinations, including Kos, Corfu, Crete and Rhodes. The agreement was officially signed at WTM London, with Garry Wilson, easyJet holidays CEO, and Greek tourism minister Olga Kefalogianni. Wilson said: “Greece is one of our most loved destinations, so we’re pleased to support its growth ambitions. I look forward to seeing a successful outcome to our partnership.” Kefalogianni added: “The memorandum of understanding with easyJet and easyJet holidays underscores Greece’s commitment to forging impactful partnerships with organizations that share our ethos and forward-looking vision. This three-year strategic plan aims to deepen collaboration, enhance mutual growth, and drive sustainable development in tourism.” WTM: Travel Innovation Driven by Hunger for Adventure Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel
WTM Regenerative Tourism Summit: Sustainability is Not Enough,https://eturbonews.com/wtm-regenerative-tourism-summit-sustainability-is-not-enough/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 6, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"The travel and tourism sector needs to see a “paradigm shift”, according to speakers at World Travel Market London ’s first Regenerative Tourism Summit. Tina O’Dwyer, founder of The Tourism Space, a sustainable and regenerative destination consultancy, said the current paradigm sees “more visitors as more value” – and tourism also contributes to carbon emissions. Highlighting other problems such as overtourism and “tourism leakage”, which means not enough money remains in holiday destinations, she warned: “There is a tipping point where more numbers mean less value. Are we brave enough to leave behind a paradigm that has worked well for us in the past? The tipping point question brings regenerative tourism to the fore; communities are looking for more value for themselves and for nature. It requires us to flip assumptions.” Anna Pollock, Founder of Conscious Travel, highlighted warnings from the World Trade Organization of a “polycrisis” – a cluster of global risks, including the climate crisis, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification and political problems. She said these issues have been seen as separate problems until recently, warning: “Sustainability is not enough. Einstein was right – no problem can be solved with the same consciousness that created it.” She said regeneration can “bring life back to that which was dying or degenerating”, adding: “You cannot keep growing and getting bigger and bigger. You have to go through a paradigm shift.” She said such a shift is starting to be seen in tourism, highlighting eco-friendly developments that are more beneficial and locally owned. Elke Dens, founder of Place Generation, highlighted case studies from around the world where regenerative tourism is tackling a wide range of issues, such as easyJet holidays helping to find solutions to water management problems in Majorca, and The Travel Corporation seeking ways to reduce emissions on its Loch Ness tours. Dens said collaborating with authorities across regional and state boundaries is important, as is liaising with indigenous people and residents. She cited the example of a nun in Bruges who worked with Visit Flanders to open up tours to see historic Latin books – benefiting both her and the destination. Delegates also heard how Fáilte Ireland, the national tourism development authority of Ireland, is helping to redevelop a vast peat bog landscape and encourage the establishment of cycling trails, glamping and “slow tourism”. The Regenerative Tourism Placemaking Program is being funded by the EU Just Transition Program to help redevelop the Midlands region, where industrial peat harvesting and fossil fuel production has been halted. Orla Carroll, Director of Product Development at Fáilte Ireland, said the tourism authority had been awarded €68 million to help create tourism jobs and regenerate the peatlands as part of a “fair, just” transition. The project drew on the learnings from the Wild Atlantic Way scheme in Ireland which increased visitor numbers to the western coastal region. Two million more tourists visited the Wild Atlantic Way in 2023 than in 2013, with an additional 35,000 additional jobs being supported in 10 years.

This demographic is loyal, tends to stay longer, and travels during off-peak seasons. The industry may be slow to adapt, but it will ultimately do so.” During the DEAI summit at WTM , he spoke about the positive changes in attitudes towards disability, advancements in government policies, technology, and representation, remarking, “We are beginning to see individuals with disabilities represented in media and leadership roles. The stigma surrounding disability is gradually diminishing.” Smith illustrated how adaptive equipment enables wheelchair users to enjoy outdoor experiences, referencing examples from Australia and his travels to locations like Machu Picchu in Peru. Additionally, Australian public agencies are working on creating accessible beaches and have established a directory that lists over 70 such locations, which provide beach wheelchairs and specialized equipment. Other amenities include “discovery tents” and all-terrain wheelchairs available in Victoria. He advised, “If I were a tour operator or involved in developing tourism products, I would certainly consider how to incorporate these elements into my offerings.” Queensland has proclaimed 2023-24 as the year of accessible tourism, in anticipation of Brisbane hosting the Paralympics in 2032, which has led to increased funding for inclusive and accessible outdoor experiences. “We are seeing the private sector start to lean into this as well,” he said, pointing to examples such as hot air balloons that feature an easy-access basket, a farm offering glamping, and a crocodile boat tour. Smith also urged operators and destinations to incorporate sustainability and indigenous experiences into their accessibility strategy, adding: “This is really where product is going in the future.” He noted how accessible tourism is “going mainstream” as it is being featured by aggregators such as Wheel the World, while the likes of Airbnb and GetYourGuide offer filters for accessibility features. Earlier in the DEAI summit, delegates heard how focusing on employees’ strengths can pay dividends, during a discussion with Mark Julian Edwards, CEO of The Strengths Explorer. He said the attraction and retention of talent in the industry is the “number one hot topic”, adding: “If we have a culture where people feel included, they are going to give more. “People who lean into their strengths have a three-times higher quality of life.” He assessed the strengths of his panelists: Jo Rzymowska, who brings 40 years of experience to her own consultancy Jovolution, which helps organizations to create better teams through more diversity, and Rosina Budhani, Senior Account Director at PR firm Palm. Rzymowska has “woo”– winning others over – and “maximiser” strengths, while Palm has “developer” and “futuristic” qualities among her strengths. “If you have a diverse team, you have a better team,” said Rzymowska, who helped Celebrity Cruises to increase its ratio of female officers from 2% to 32%. She also set up employee resource groups so staff learned about different types of people within the company, and led a marketing project to create a photo library of real guests on cruises rather than stereotypical heterosexual parents with 2.4 kids.

TSA Administrator David Pekoske stated, “TSA has worked in close partnership with industry stakeholders to enhance the cybersecurity resilience of the nation’s essential transportation infrastructure. The proposed rule aims to expand upon this collaborative initiative and further fortify the cybersecurity framework for surface transportation entities. We anticipate valuable feedback from both industry participants and the public regarding this proposed regulation.” This rule reflects TSA’s ongoing dedication to performance-based requirements. It builds upon the performance-oriented cybersecurity mandates that TSA has issued through annual Security Directives since 2021, utilizing the cybersecurity framework established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the cross-sector cybersecurity performance objectives created by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). In alignment with these standards and requirements, this rule proposes: It is necessary for specific pipeline, freight railroad, passenger railroad, and rail transit owner/operators identified as having elevated cybersecurity risk profiles to develop and uphold a thorough cyber risk management program. These owner/operators, along with those operating higher-risk bus-only public transportation and over-the-road bus services, who are already mandated to report significant physical security issues to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), will also be required to report cybersecurity incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Furthermore, the TSA’s existing requirements for rail and higher-risk bus operations will be expanded to include higher-risk pipeline owner/operators, necessitating the appointment of a physical security coordinator and the reporting of significant physical security concerns to the TSA. The TSA emphasizes that maintaining a robust cybersecurity framework is essential for ensuring that the surface transportation sector is adequately prepared to address and manage cyber risks. The stipulations outlined in this proposed regulation aim to enhance cybersecurity resilience throughout the surface transportation systems sector.

NEOM, Amaala, Red Sea Global, Jeddah Historical and KAEC, were among the coastal destinations that were present on stand, showcasing the rich offerings of the new super destination. In an exclusive reveal, trade partners were introduced to the undiscovered coastal marvel that spans 1,800km of coastline with expansive on-land and in-water products.

Also, on the first day at WTM, Hazim Al-Hazmi, President of Europe and Americas Markets at the Saudi Tourism Authority, participated in a panel discussion with industry leaders on ‘The Intersection of Entertainment, Events, and Leisure Travel.’ Reflecting on Saudi’s all-year-round events calendar, he spoke about marquee events such as Sound Storm by MDL Beast, Riyadh Season, Italian Super Cup and the Spanish Super Cup, Formula 1 Grand Prix, and global boxing matches that have become synonymous with Saudi’s dynamic Winter calendar. With consumer demand for Saudi tourism at an all-time high, the country is gearing up once again for a busy winter holiday travel season following the launch of its “Where Winter Lights Up” campaign. He underscored the necessity of taking social aspects into consideration when planning and executing events that impact society – creating jobs and business opportunities, and elevating people’s quality of life.

World Travel Market Closes Packed Halls of Day 1,https://eturbonews.com/world-travel-market-closes-packed-halls-of-day-1/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 5, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"WTM London and its Global Travel Partner the Saudi Tourism Authority both hailed the economic and cultural importance of the sector as the event opened its doors on November 5. Speaking at the WTM Global Welcome, Jonathan Heastie, WTM Portfolio Director, said: “The halls are packed already for what is the biggest WTM London to date. More than 4,000 exhibitors have joined us this year; there are delegates here from 184 countries around the world. “It is a remarkable turnout and I think it’s going to be a remarkable World Travel Market gathering.” “ This time last year, £2.2 billion worth of travel deals were done in these halls, This year, you will hear from more than 200 world-class speakers in 70 enlightening sessions.” Fahd Hamidaddin, chief executive and board member for Saudi Tourism Authority, said: “Tourism powers economies more than anything. The jobs we create are the jobs for the young, the entrepreneurs, for the remote, for the pop-and-mom shops and for the new rising talents. When we travel, we go with our best intentions. Our minds are the most open.” Many sessions at today’s show were devoted to the DEAI conference track. Speaking in one of the panels, LoAnn Halden VP of communications for IGLTA (International LGBTQ+ Travel Association) urged travel companies not to merely pay lip service to diversity for Pride or Black History Month but to address longer term social inclusion. She recommended having ‘internal allies’ who understand under-represented groups. Jane Cunningham, director of European engagement for Destinations International noted that good diversity and inclusion was “not only [welcoming] for visitors but very much serving the citizens who live in that destination.” Commenting on stereotyping in advertising, Debbie Marshall, managing director for the Silver Marketing Association warned companies to consult the demographic they were marketing to before producing materials. Hafsa Gaher director of Halal Travel Network meanwhile shared practical tips to help hotels welcome more Halal observing guests including having vegetarian options, providing a list of nearby Halal eateries and offering to remove alcohol from minibars. WTM attendees also learned that Greece has made several advances in tourism accessibility in recent years including adding Seatrack infrastructure to 250 beaches to enable disabled people to reach the water. Eleni Skarveli, director of the Greece National Tourism Organisation said treating guests well was part of the destination’s motivation to improve its DEAI: “I think hospitality is really in our DNA. We want visitors to be fed, to be happy to have a smile and have a good time.” The first day of the Technology Track covered the theory and practice of frictionless travel. Executives from airlines, tech providers and OTAs talked about the complexities within the airline industry that are making frictionless travel difficult to achieve at scale. The sessions concluded with a debate in which the audience was asked to vote on whether technology was causing the complexity or whether it was the processes embedded into the global aviation industry. The result was around 50/50. Visit Maldives chose WTM London to launch “the world’s biggest holiday giveaway”, with one travel prize per week up for grabs in an effort to attract “new travellers from new markets.” Shiuree Ibrahim, chief executive and managing director at Visit Maldives said: “The Maldives is evolving to cater to all the interests of travellers – diversifying with sports tourism, medical tourism and film tourism. The destination, which is set to reach a record two million visitors in 2024, also hopes to be using 30% renewable energy by 2030. Next year will see events to mark the 60th anniversary of the country’s independence from the UK. India meanwhile showcased its free e-visa initiative, Chalo India, with Mugdha Sinha, director-general of the country’s tourism ministry, urging those in the Indian diaspora around the world to encourage five non-Indian friends to sign up for the scheme. The destination welcomed 9.5 million tourists in 2023, with 920,000 coming from the UK, making it its third-largest inbound market. The UK also has a large Indian diaspora population of nearly 2.4 million.

Mugdha Sinha, the Director-General of India’s tourism ministry, urged those in the Indian diaspora around the world to encourage five non-Indian friends to sign up for the scheme. She said Indians across the world can recommend the initiative to their non-Indian friends, with more information available on the Chalo India portal. India welcomed 9.5 million tourists in 2023, with 920,000 coming from the UK, making it the third-largest inbound market. The UK also has a large Indian diaspora population of nearly 2.4 million. Sinha also highlighted the wide diversity of attractions across India, with 150 new, alternative destinations being developed that are “pro-planet and sustainable”. “The diversity is humungous,” she told WTM London, pointing to India’s 7,500km coastline, and the fact it has some of the tallest mountains in the world, wildlife sanctuaries, eco-destinations, craftspeople and homestays. “We are marketing India as a destination for all seasons,” she added, noting infrastructure developments over the past 10 years such as more roads, airports and direct flights to more regions. The ministry recently relaunched the Incredible India content hub and digital portal, enabling travelers to book accommodation, flights, homestays and even cruises. It also features travel diaries from those who have visited “hidden gems”, she added. Other offerings she highlighted range from festivals, wedding tourism, spiritual and religious locations, to Blue Flag beaches and luxury trains such as the Deccan Express and Maharajas’ Express. The business events market is another growing sector, which was boosted by India’s G20 presidency last year. Other representatives from the India delegation showcasing their regions included Jupally Krishna Rao, Telangana Tourism Minister; Goa’s Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte; and Pravati Parida, Deputy Chief Minister of Odisha. Parida said the state of Odisha is “the best-kept secret”, with 64 tribes, music and folk festivals, sports events and mango groves. Khaunte told delegates how Goa has a population of 1.5 million but attracts 15 million tourists a year. It is encouraging visitors beyond its beaches to experience its ecotourism offerings, cuisine, activity holidays, festivals and homestays. Krishna Rao told delegates about Telangana’s history, culture, temples and cuisine, notably the Hyderabad biryani.

WTM: Extreme weather affects travelers’ destinations choice,https://eturbonews.com/wtm-extreme-weather-affects-travelers-destinations-choice/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 5, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Travelers are actively starting to avoid destinations which are exposed to extreme weather, according to the latest WTM Global Travel Report, released today. The report, in association with Tourism Economics, found that 29% of travelers from key global markets have avoided visiting a destination in past 12 months due to concerns about inclement or extreme weather. Gen Z – travelers aged between 18 and 34 – are more likely than the average to avoid destinations exposed to extreme weather, with more than two in five (43%) admitting to reconsidering where to go. Extreme weather – such as wildfires, flooding, unusually high temperatures – is widely accepted to be a direct result of man-made climate change. Evidence is emerging that extreme weather events will become more prevalent and widespread as the climate continues to warm. The report references an MIT study which introduced the concept of “outdoor days” as a way to measure the impact of climate change through to 2100. Outdoor days are defined as days on which outdoor activities can be undertaken in comfort. The WTM study pulled out the data for some popular destinations and found that Thailand, for example, will have 55 fewer outdoor days. In contrast, Canada will have 23 more. Tourism Economics data in the report shows that only a slight majority (53%) of travelers say that they attempt to minimize their carbon footprint when travelling. At the same time, nearly two in three (65%) of travelers acknowledge that travel has a negative impact on the environment. That disconnect can be closed by travel sellers helping travelers to make climate-friendly and sustainable choices. Booking.com figures from 2023 are quoted, which showed that 74% of travelers want more sustainable options made available, and that 65% would feel better staying in accommodation with sustainable certification. However, sellers and suppliers with a strong sustainability story to tell are being held back by concerns over “green washing”. Skift research cited in the report shows that 75% of travelers are skeptical about travel company’s sustainable practices. Overtourism and the impact on local communities and resources is an important part of the sustainability conversation. In Europe, cities such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice have been trying to address this but, according to Tourism Economics data, there has been little change. Using 2019 as a base level, visitor nights per capita or “travel density” for these three cities has increased, albeit marginally, over the past five years. Juliette Losardo, Exhibition Director, World Travel Market, said: “Travel is perhaps the industry most exposed to the climate emergency and the wider concerns around sustainability. These are issues which are embedded into what travelers want and how the industry operates, but the report highlights some ways in which the industry can continue to grow while maintaining its commitment to reducing emissions. “Our role at WTM is to inform and educate, and there is a lot in the latest WTM Global Travel report which sellers and suppliers can take away and inform their own decision-making process when it comes to the climate and sustainability.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxEemrzebtU WTM: Travel Innovation Driven by Hunger for Adventure Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel
Jamaica Tourism Minister Advocates Supply-Side Growth to Boost Investment,https://eturbonews.com/jamaica-tourism-minister-advocates-supply-side-growth-to-boost-investment/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 5, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"Speaking at the International Tourism and Investment Conference (ITIC) Global Tourism Investment Summit in London yesterday, the Minister highlighted that owning the supply side has the potential to create favourable conditions for investors and to retain more of the foreign exchange earned locally from the industry. “Tourism owns nothing yet depends on every other sector and industry to operate, and this is where we can capitalize on increasing the earnings.” “Our farmers, manufacturers, and creatives can supply the increasing demands within tourism with their goods and services and earn more, leading to a greater retention of the dollar,” said Minister Bartlett. Minister Bartlett was participating in the summit’s Investment Ministerial Panel under the theme: “The responsibility of governments to develop a strategic plan for an investment-focused tourism agenda of the future.” The panel included Ms. Mariana Oleskiv, Chairperson, State Agency for Tourism Development, Ukraine; Hon. Rebecca Miano, Cabinet Secretary for Tourism and Wildlife, Kenya; Hon. Vera Kamtukule, Minister of Tourism, Malawi; and Siby Diabira, Senior Manager, Western Europe, International Finance Corporation (IFC). “Focusing on the supply side can also be used to attract more investment for tourism infrastructure by streamlining processes for potential investors. This approach represents a paradigm shift in how we attract tourism investment. Instead of solely focusing on demand generation through marketing, we can create the conditions that make our region irresistible to strategic investors,” the tourism minister noted. “To also support greater access to our tourism value chain by retaining more of the foreign exchange earned, we established the Tourism Linkages Network to strengthen the partnership between tourism and other sectors like agriculture and manufacturing to ensure more local production. The more we can provide locally for the demands of tourism, the more we can generate wealth for our local suppliers and communities,” added Minister Bartlett. The ITIC summit is a highly anticipated annual event on the World Travel Market (WTM) calendar that brings together tourism ministers, industry leaders, and developers from the tourism, travel, and hospitality sectors to connect with potential investors. It is a platform to promote global awareness and investment in sustainable tourism projects worldwide. The Minister is leading a delegation at the 2024 WTM scheduled for November 5-7. WTM London is the most influential travel and tourism event globally. The popular event brings together the international leisure travel community, providing inspiration, education, sourcing, and benchmarking to travel professionals while providing exhibitors a place to do business and showcase their services to the international press. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L4SnBQpVPM Jamaica Tourism Minister Stresses Need for Enhanced Commonwealth Cooperation to Drive Growth Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel
Jamaica Tourism Minister Stresses Need for Enhanced Commonwealth Cooperation to Drive Growth,https://eturbonews.com/jamaica-tourism-minister-stresses-need-for-enhanced-commonwealth-cooperation-to-drive-growth/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 5, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"Speaking at the prestigious International Tourism and Investment Conference (ITIC) Global Tourism Investment Summit at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre in London, England, Minister Bartlett called on Commonwealth countries to join forces in making tourism a transformative driver of inclusive growth. “The Commonwealth, with its 2.7 billion people across 56 diverse nations, represents one of the most potent platforms for economic collaboration in the world,” said Minister Bartlett. “Not only are we spread across continents—from Africa to the Pacific—but 60% of our population is under 29. This youth demographic represents a powerful force for innovation, adaptability, and growth in tourism,” he noted, emphasizing the dynamic and youthful makeup of Commonwealth citizens. The ITIC Global Tourism Investment Summit is an annual gathering that brings together key stakeholders, including tourism ministers, industry leaders and potential investors, to discuss investment opportunities in sustainable tourism. Bartlett utilized this platform to spotlight the Commonwealth’s unique ability to use tourism as a means to foster economic resilience and elevate its geopolitical influence on the world stage. Highlighting the substantial economic landscape of the Commonwealth, Minister Bartlett added, “Our combined GDP reached approximately $14.2 trillion in 2022, with a trajectory toward $20 trillion by 2029. This reflects not only the economic scale but the diversity among member nations, from large economies like India and the UK to our smaller island states.” Intra-Commonwealth trade, which reached $854 billion in 2022, is projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2026, offering vast potential for growth in sectors such as tourism, food trade, foreign direct investment and services. Minister Bartlett also advocated for using tourism as a soft power tool to strengthen the Commonwealth’s standing globally. “Tourism not only transfers wealth quickly but does so in a way that directly benefits communities at all levels. When tourists arrive, they contribute immediately to local economies, bringing revenue to ordinary people,” he explained. He encouraged the Commonwealth Secretariat to lead the charge in enhancing visitor facilitation, open skies agreements, visa liberalization and technology integration to boost connectivity among member states. In his vision, Bartlett spoke passionately about the possibilities for multi-destination tourism within the Commonwealth. “Our member countries have a rich cultural and social diversity that is tailor-made for experiential tourism. Commonwealth travelers can have unique experiences across the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific without encountering the same setting twice. This type of multi-destination tourism allows regions to come together to create package offerings that provide tourists with diverse experiences in one trip,” he said. Bartlett further highlighted advancements in aviation as an untapped opportunity to facilitate greater travel within the Commonwealth. “Today’s aviation technology enables larger, fuel-efficient aircraft to cover vast distances in shorter times. This is an exciting moment for the Commonwealth to harness these advancements, making it easier for our citizens to travel across our diverse nations and enjoy the wonders of different cultures,” he added. In closing, Minister Bartlett called for Commonwealth leaders to recognize tourism as an essential pillar for economic resilience and growth. “His Majesty the King has spoken of a ‘stronger Commonwealth,’ and tourism can play a pivotal role in realizing that vision. By investing in tourism infrastructure, human capital development and collaborative initiatives, we can strengthen our economies and foster deeper connections among our people.” Minister Bartlett’s remarks at the ITIC Summit reflect Jamaica’s commitment to building partnerships and exploring new avenues for tourism-driven economic growth. The call for Commonwealth unity in tourism signals a progressive approach that seeks to create wealth, sustain cultural heritage, and bring economic prosperity to all member nations.

WTM: Travel Innovation Driven by Hunger for Adventure,https://eturbonews.com/wtm-travel-innovation-driven-by-hunger-for-adventure/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 5, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"The rise of the global middle class is driving more demand for new holiday experiences – prompting the industry to offer more adventurous options, according to research from World Travel Market London , the world’s most influential travel and tourism event. The exclusive WTM Global Travel Report – compiled in association with renowned researchers at Oxford Economics – has revealed that the emergence of more affluent consumers in markets around the world is driving “shifts” in the traditional travel norms – with some intrepid travelers even seeking riskier activities. WTM Report: Global overnight arrivals pass record 1.5 billion “The popularity of travel has fueled remarkable creativity. Be it volcano-boarding in Nicaragua or cage-diving with sharks in South Africa, a broadening range of activities is available to consumers, driven by growing demand for new and unique experiences,” said the report, unveiled at WTM London on 5 November. “Consumers are also more open to adventure, thrill-seeking and extreme experiences. “Soft adventure activities, which are generally low risk and require limited experience, such as hiking, cycling and wildlife watching, represent the largest share of adventure tourism opportunities. “However, hard adventure activities, like skydiving, mountaineering and whitewater rafting, are likely to gain increased traction among a typically wealthier audience more open to adventure and willing to take higher risks. This type of riskier travel is also known as frontier travel.” Tourism Economics – an Oxford Economics company – found that 29% of travelers reported increased interest in adventure travel; 34% of consumers reported a growing interest in rural and nature-based tourism; and 57% of travelers are more interested in visiting new destinations compared to five years ago. This increased demand for fresh places to visit will drive growth in smaller countries, such as Armenia and Serbia in Europe, as well as African destinations which offer safari holidays and adventure travel, added the report. Saudi Arabia and Albania achieved visitor arrival growth of 80% and 74% respectively in 2024 compared to 2019, it noted, thanks to the urge to explore off the beaten track. The “experience economy”, in which consumers prioritize memories over physical goods, has also seen growth over the last decade as developing markets have spent a higher share of their disposable income on travel, catching up the proportion of spending in many advanced economies. Furthermore, Gen Z and Millennials place greater emphasis on experiences rather than materialistic goods, “which bodes well for the travel outlook”, added the report. “The seemingly boundless opportunities for travel companies to innovate by offering distinct and personalized offerings, aided by technology, presents exciting possibilities for the industry,” it said. Juliette Losardo, Exhibition Director at WTM London, said: “This WTM Global Travel Report is a crucial overview for the industry to see how trends have developed during 2024 and what could be around the corner in 2025 and beyond. “With the rise of the middle class in many more countries, there’s ever more demand for more unusual and authentic experiences as holidaymakers want to get under the skin of different cultures – or even tick off those exciting bucket-list activities with the ‘frontier’ travel trend we’ve been seeing. “Our report will prompt discussions throughout the three days of WTM London and beyond, helping drive the innovation that will support sustainable growth in our sector.” Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel
WTM Report: Global Overnight Arrivals Pass Record 1.5 Billion,https://eturbonews.com/wtm-report-global-overnight-arrivals-pass-record-1-5-billion/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 5, 2024",N/A,Harry Johnson,"Global travel growth will reach a significant milestone in 2024 as international tourism arrivals are expected to hit 1.5 billion, surpassing 2019 values. The record is one of the trends revealed in the WTM Global Travel Report in conjunction with Tourism Economics, which will be unveiled at World Travel Market London on Tuesday 5 November. By 2030, overnight tourism arrivals (i.e. international visitors staying at least one night) are projected to have grown by over 30% to two billion, aided by emerging outbound markets. Spend is also rising. Global leisure tourism expenditure in 2024 is now worth over US$5.5 trillion, a level 24% above 2019 values. Most significantly, consumers appear to be prioritizing travel with it accounting for a greater share of their spending in the major advanced economies than in the 10 years pre-pandemic. WTM: Travel Innovation Driven by Hunger for Adventure Overall, according to Tourism Economics data, travel spending as a percentage of consumer spending reached 8.8% in 2024, compared to an average 8.2% between 2010 and 2019. Even in markets such as Asia Pacific where some destinations, notably China, have lagged the recovery, travel as a share of consumer spending is returning close to the heights of 2019. Increased length of stay Globally, the number of overnight stays in all paid accommodation is this year set to exceed 2023 levels by 7% and 2019 levels by 16% according to Tourism Economics. The figures do not wholly reflect a similar growth in visits however as stays are getting longer. Average length of stay for both domestic and international travel declined in the decade prior to the pandemic but has increased in the recovery period and remains above the pre-covid average. In fact, the average length of stay in hotels on international trips was up 12% in 2024 compared to 2019, more than offsetting the 8% fall over the previous decade. Several trends feed into this lengthening of stay. According to the Tourism Economics Travel Trends Survey, some people are choosing deeper and more sustainable ‘slow travel’ perhaps cutting frequency in favor of longer more engaged trips. Tourism Economics also notes a significant growth in so-called ‘bleisure’ with business travelers staying on for extra leisure-orientated days. Juliette Losardo, Exhibitor Director, WTM London, said commented: “WTM’s aim is to help attendees navigate change, ensuring travel professionals are equipped for the year ahead. Commissioning the WTM Global Travel Report supports our commitment to providing attendees with the latest trends shaping the travel landscape. “Using an expansive databank covering more than 185 countries worldwide as destinations and as origin markets, covering all major bilateral tourism flows in terms of visits, nights and spend, as well as unique industry insights, the report gives a comprehensive outlook on tourism.” Subscribe Print Email X Facebook LinkedIn Telegram WhatsApp VK Messenger SMS Reddit Flipboard Pinterest Tumblr Xing Buffer Hacker News Share Line Mix Pocket Yummly Copy",business_travel
Destinations International Reveals Making Travel More Accessible,https://eturbonews.com/destinations-international-reveals-making-travel-more-accessible/,"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20145%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E","November 4, 2024",N/A,Linda Hohnholz,"Destinations International (DI), the world’s leading association representing destination organizations and convention and visitors bureaus (CVBs), and City Destinations Alliance (CityDNA), the alliance of tourist boards, convention bureaus and destination management organizations in Europe, today issued the “Global Accessibility Report”, a collaborative research effort offering a foundational understanding of the global initiatives around accessibility. The report was released at the GDS-Forum & City DNA Autumn Conference 2024. Global accessibility is essential to ensuring that all individuals, regardless of physical, sensory, cognitive, or unseen disabilities, have equal opportunities to experience the world through travel. With a global disabled population of 16% (1.85 billion people), investing in accessibility is not just a moral imperative but a strategic necessity for destinations and a source of economic impact. UN Tourism defines accessibility to facilities, products and services as a core component of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy. Through accessible tourism, destinations can empower people with disabilities to travel independently and confidently, providing them with seamless, safe and enriching experiences. Prioritizing accessibility also showcases a destination’s commitment to ethical tourism and human rights and reinforces the travel and tourism industry as socially responsible and forward-thinking. The Global Accessibility Report shares insights from a survey fielded in early 2024 of 92 destinations. 65% of respondents represent destination marketing organizations; 63% were in Europe and 25% in North America. The report has three primary objectives: to understand the challenges and opportunities in creating inclusive environments that benefit everyone; to assess the state of destination accessibility; to identify gaps and highlight innovative practices that foster more welcoming and inclusive spaces; and to inspire and motivate organizations to improve accessibility for residents and visitors of all ages, backgrounds and abilities. “Accessibility matters not only to visitors but also to local communities, and destination organizations are starting to recognize the significance of providing inclusive facilities, products, and services for everyone.” Sophia Hyder Hock, DI Chief Inclusion Officer, added: “It’s not just a key factor for a thriving destination – it’s the ethical choice. We hope this report will help the tourism industry advance this critical effort.” “Ensuring accessibility is more than just meeting regulations – it’s about creating meaningful, inclusive experiences for all visitors. City Destinations Alliance is proud to collaborate on this important research, providing our members with insights and tools to lead the way in building destinations where everyone feels welcome and empowered to explore,” said Barbara Jamison-Woods, President of City Destinations Alliance. The Global Accessibility Report serves as a catalyst for destinations to evolve their strategies and shape a more inclusive future for tourism. DI and CityDNA encourage destination organizations, convention and visitors bureaux, and regional and national tourism bureaus to reflect on their current accessibility practices and use the report’s insights to implement changes that support this growth opportunity and greater belonging. Additionally, industry stakeholders, funding agencies, subject matter experts and advocacy groups can leverage these insights to support destinations and contribute to collective progress. The report provides a roadmap for enhancing inclusivity, ultimately creating more equitable tourism experiences for all. The Global Accessibility Report is available on both the Destinations International website and CityDNA website .

At the time of the collapse, around noon local time, people were sitting on the benches beneath the outdoor overhang at the Serbia’s second-largest city’s railway station. According to Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, at least three additional people were rescued and subsequently hospitalized with severe injuries. Among them are two females that were rescued alive from beneath the debris a few hours following the collapse. According to local officials, the train station building underwent renovations in 2021 and was further updated this year, with the official opening scheduled for July 5; however, the section of the roof that collapsed was not included in the reconstruction efforts. A high-speed train link between Novi Sad and Belgrade was launched in March 2022. “Serbian Railways regrets the accident that occurred, and the causes and any new details from the investigation will be promptly announced,” Serbian Railways wrote in a social media post. Prime Minister Miloš Vučević stated that all individuals deemed responsible for the upkeep of the canopy, constructed in 1964, will be held accountable, according to media reports. Serbian government has designated Saturday as an official day of mourning.
